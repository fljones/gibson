    ATONEMENT HEALING Scriptural or Unscriptural?
    Atonement healing is a popular message preached in the Pentecostal and Neo-Pentecostal churches.  It is based on the premise that through Christ’s suffering and death the effects of the Adamic curse were nullified.  It maintains that what satan stole and destroyed, Jesus completely restored.
    Ever since the late 19 th century and the beginning of the twentieth century, there has been a revival of the supernatural gifts of the Spirit.  With this came a new interest in Divine healing.  Even today its popularity is still on the increase in many evangelical churches. People seem to be searching for a more real experience in their Christian walk.  They are yearning for answers to life’s problems and sorrows.  They are leaving the mainline churches because the preaching of a watered-down gospel has left them empty and, consequently, they are in search of a dynamic, personal gospel message.  They want to believe that “God is still on the throne, and prayer changes things”.
    This paper will attempt to address the topic of healing from a sound, biblical approach.  At the outset, we would like to answer the question that the title of this paper poses:  Is atonement healing scriptural? Yes.  Although the answer to this question concurs with the atonenent healing advocates, the writer answers this question from a different perspective.  It is the purpose of this paper to present that perspective and to elucidate its qualifying statements.  There will be three primary areas of discussion:  (1) a validation of the miraculous gifts, (2) an examination of the passages used to support atonement healing and, (3) a re-evaluation of atonement healing re flecting the writer’s view.
    I.  The first topic of discussion will now be considered.  In that healing falls within the realm of the supernatural, it is felt that a study of the sign gifts as an active operation of the Spirit be validated.  The establishment of this premise is critical in that many in Christendom maintain that the miraculous aspect of God’s relationship to man has ceased.  Although some would not be so bold as to assert this belief, they, nevertheless, diminuate God’s power to
    the extent that they render him ineffectual.  The biblical text which deals with the sign gifts is found in 1 Cor. 12-14.  It is not the objective of this paper to treat the Corinthian text in its entirety, but merely consider a few verses of it.
    Some biblical scholars feel that the sign gifts ceased at the closing of the canon. The basis for this view is founded on their interpretation of 1 Cor. 13:8-10.
    “Charity never faileth; but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.  For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.  But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.”
    Although many scholars include all of the charismatic gifts in this cessation, others maintain that it pertained only to those specifically cited.  According to their reasoning, the sign gifts were necessary for the establishment of the infant (immature) church.  They argue that with the full revelation of the counsel of God’s will,that is, the completed New Testament, the provisional charismata (gifts) were no longer necessary.  Even a novice of early church history recognizes that the church plunged into apostasy toward the beginning of the 4 thcentury.  This is approximately the same period of time when the charismata were on the wane and the church entered its so called state of “maturity”.
    We will now further consider the passage of 1 Cor. 13:8-10.  In regard to the word “perfect” in verse 10, since it is neuter gender, they maintain that it cannot refer to Christ.  Consequently, the completed canon of scripture is said to be what the Apostle Paul was referring to.  Although “perfect” is neuter gender, to say that it refers to the completed canon is a forced interpretation, to say the least.  Thayer, in his famous Greek-English Lexicon, states that teleios (perfect) may have the following meanings:  “brought to its end, finished; wanting nothing necessary to completeness; perfect.” In reference to its usage in 1 Cor. 13:10, Thayer states that teleios refers to “the perfect state of all things, to be ushered in by the return of Christ from heaven.”  That this is the correct rendering is evident from the next two verses.
    “When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child. I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.
    For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face:  now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.”
    In verse 11 Paul gives the analogy of maturation to show that the charismata will indeed cease, but that will only come when the church has reached its maturity.  When will this occur?  In Paul’s own words in 1 Cor. 15:23,24 “...afterward they that are Christ’s at his coming. Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.”
    With reference to verses 10 & 12, the Wycliffe Bible Commentary phrases it well:  “that which is perfect cannot be a reference to the completion of the canon of scripture; otherwise we now, living in the age of the completed canon, would see more clearly than Paul did.  Even the most self-satisfied and opinionated of theologians would hardly admit that.  The coming of that which is perfect can only be a reference to the Lord’s second coming.  That event will mark the end of the exercise of prophecy, tongues, and knowledge.”
    This is the concensus of most reputable biblical scholars.  Those that dogmaticly insist that verse 10 refers to the completed canon do so because of their biased and prejudiced theological views completely ignoring accepted grammatical hermeneutics.  Most theologians because of their professional integrity give the correct interpretation even in deference to their personal views.  Excerpts from a selection of various commentaries in regard to verse 10 will now be given. Matthew Henry’s Commentary.  “When the end is once attained, the means will of course be abolished.  There will be no need of tongues, and prophecy, and inspired knowledge, in a future life, because then the church will be in a state of perfection, complete both in knowledge and holiness...Such is the difference between earth and heaven.” Jamieson, Fausset, Brown Commentary.  “Shall be done away with, i.e., shall be dispensed with at the Lord’s coming, being superseded by their more perfect heavenly analogues.”
    Clark’s Commentary. “The state of eternal blessedness; that which is imperfect shall be done away; the imperfect as well as the probation-ing state shall cease forever.”
    Matthew Poole’s Commentary.  “But when we come to heaven, we shall be in such a state, as nothing shall or can be added to us; then our partial and imperfect knowledge shall be swallowed up in a knowledge perfect and complete.”
    The New Bible Commentary.  “Prophecy and tongues will not be necessary in the immediate presence of God...when the perfect comes:  not perfection in quality so much as totality; i.e., full knowledge about God.” The Expositor’s Greek Testament.  “But when there comes the perfect (full-grown, mature), the ‘in part* will be abolished; this teleiosis is brought about at the parousai—it ‘comes 1 with the Lord from heaven.”
    Although many scholars when exegeting verse 10 interpret it in reference to the time of Christ’s second advent will, in the very next verse, give a forced interpretation in order to maintain their established dogmas.  To illustrate this, an excerpt from the Wycliffe Bible Commentary will be given.
    “The coming of that which is perfect can only be a reference to the Lord’s second coming.  That event will mark the end of the exercise of prophecy, tongues, and knowledge.  How then can we speak of these gifts as temporary? The following verse will answer the question...With reference to these particular gifts, it may be likened to the growing up of a person from infancy to manhood.  The special and spectacular gifts were necessary in the early stages of the growth of the true church for purposes of authentication and edification when there was no New Testament to give light...today it is questionable that there exists anywhere the scriptural exercise of the three gifts referred to by Paul in this passage.” This is a classic example of theological “double-talk”.  With one breath he unequivocably states that the charismata were destined to continue until the second coming of Christ.  And in the very next breath states that they would last only until the New Testament was completely written.  The New Testament would then be the instrument used to give authentication and edification to the church.
    Another example of how scholarly theologians may sometimes allow good biblical hermeneutics to succ«mfcto their theological dogmas and denominational prejudices will be illustrated from A.T.Robertson’s Word Pictures in the New Testament.  He gives the following comment regarding 1 Cor. 13:8:  “All these special spiritual gifts will pass. It is amazing how little of human work lasts.” Because of his personal/ denominational biasness, he diminuates the Holy Spirit’s charismata (supernatural gifts) to the level of human work.  He also utilizes the
    ”last, therefore least” theory in reference to the gift of tongues. In commenting on 1 Cor. 12:10 he states:  “Paul placed this gift lowest of all.  It created wonder, but did little real good.”  In referring to the list of the charismata in 1 Cor. 12:28, Robertson succir&ly says, “...glSssSn(tongues), last again.”  He incorporates theological “double-talk” when commenting on tongues in 1 Cor. 13:1 whenUhe says, “mentioned first because really least;” Here, he changes direction in mid-stream.  It is a tortured logic that affirms as true mutually contradictory propositions.  Whether or not glSssOn-lalia (speaking in tongues) is indeed the least of the gifts should not be a matter of record.  One approaches the sphere of arrogance when it is stated that one of God’s gifts “created wonder, but did little real good.”  Ignorance of an experience does not authorize one to disclaim the reality or worth of that experience.
    The only point that is being stressed in the foregoing passage is that scholarly exegesis is sometimes sacrificed at the expense of preconceived denominational views.
    One wonders, then, why the supernatural gifts (healing included) gradually became a forgotten experience within the Christian church. A possible answer to this question may be gleaned from the Corinthian text presently being studied.  Since there was an obvious abuse and misuse of some of the charismata which God had given to the Body of Christ, there were segments of the Corinthian church which were trying to solve the problem by forbidding completely the exercise of some of these gifts during the worship service.  This can be seen from Paul’s words in 1 Cor. 14:39.
    “Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.”
    The tense of the verb form ‘forbid not 1 is known in the Greek as present imperative.  According to Dana and Mantey’s famous Greek Grammar, “a prohibition in the present imperative demands that action then in progress be stopped.” For example, the American Standard Version rendering of Matt. 7:1 is:  “judge not, that ye be not judged. 1 But this translation does not do justice to the real import of the idiom, which could be more accurately translated, “stop judging, lest you be judged.” Another illustration is Rev. 5:4,5:  “And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book...and one of
    the elders saith unto me, weep not.” More precisely rendered, it means, “I was weeping...he said to me, stop weeping.”
    So, the Apostle Paul is actually saying “stop forbidding to speak with tongues.”  A similar problem was encountered by Paul in the church in Thessalonica.  There were certain Thessalonians who were also limiting and forbidding the exercise of certain of the sign gifts.  This was being done by conscientious Christians who were trying to combat gnostic influences who were abusing the spiritual gifts.  The gnostic’s expressions were frequently orgiastic.  Even its boasted “esoteric knowledge (gnSsis) was derived in part from ecstatic experiences” (The Abingdon Bible Commentary).  According to 1 Thess. 5:19,20, the Thessalonians were actively quenching the Spirit and were despising prophesyings.  The Pulpit Commentary gives the following comment concerning 1 Thess. 5:19,20:  “by the Spirit here is usually understood the miraculous gifts of the Spirit— speaking with tongues or prophesyings; and it is supposed that the apostle here forbids the exercise of these gifts being hindered or checked.”
    Although the motives of the Corinthian and Thessalonian Christ ians might have been noble, their actions were wrong.  They were, according to an old adage, “throwing the baby out with the bathwater.”
    We surmise that after the death of the Apostles the church manifested this same type of reactionary response in regard to a certain heresy known as Montanism which originated in the region of Phrygia.  Much of the following material concerning the heresy of Montanism will be taken from McClintock and Strong’s Cyclopedia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Literature.
    Montanus, the founder of a sect named after him Montanists, was a Phrygian by birth.  He was brought up in heathenism, but ap pears to have embraced Christianity (about 170 A.D.) with all the fanatical enthusiasm for which his countrymen were noted.  The frenzy, the paroxysms, the fierce belief in the supernatural that marked the old Phrygian priests of Cybele and Bacchus are repeated under less savage, but not less abnormal conditions, in the ecstasies of the Montanists.  His principal associates were two prophetesses, named Prisca, or Priscilla, and Maximilla.  These two women, after being indoctrinated by Montanus, abandoned their husbands in order to follow him.
    The Montanists proclaimed that the age of the Holy Ghost and the millennial reign had been established in the village of Papuza, in Western Phrygia, which they termed the New Jerusalem.  Those who followed the Holy Ghost, speaking through these new prophets, were held to be the only genuine Christians, and were to form the church. The Montanists believed that Christ, who came to fulfill the law and the prophets, and promised his Holy Spirit to his apostles to guide them into all truth, bequeathed to his church only an insufficient morality, and the Paraclete of Montanus was needed to supplement the new dispensation.  The Paraclete is undeniably identified with the promised Spirit of Truth, but was not ultimately given in its ful ness until the Spirit came on Montanus.
    Irenaeus, the bishop of Lyons (180-202 A.D.), was one of the great defenders of the Christian faith during the last part of the second century and beginning of the third century.  In the book, The Ante-Nicene Fathers, Irenaeus gives the following account con cerning Montanism in his treatise, “Irenaeus Against Heresies”.
    “Others, again (the Montanists), that they may set aside the gift of the Spirit which in the later times has been, by the good pleasure of the Father, poured out upon the human race, do not admit that aspect of the evangelical dispensation presented by John’s gospel, in which the Lord promised that He would send the Paraclete; but set aside at once both the gospel and the prophetic Spirit.  Wretched men indeed!  Who wish to be pseudo-prophets, forsooth, but who set at nought the gift of prohecy from the church... We must conclude, moreover, that these men (the Montanists) cannot admit the Apostle Paul either.  For, in his Epistle to the Corinthians, he speaks expressly of prophetical gifts, and recognizes men and women prophesying in the church.”
    It would seem that Irenaeus is saying in the above discourse that the Montanists deny the charismata.  But what he is really expressing, if his entire treatise against heresies is examined, is that the gifts that Montanus and his followers were exercising were false and do not have their origin from God.  The theory that this paper proposes to the reader is that the church, in order to combat
    this Phrygian heresy, began to quench the Holy Spirit’s operation in the worship services.  When there was a manifestation of one of the gifts of the Spirit, the church would automatically began to question within themselves whether this was truly from God or whether it was influenced by the Montanist heresy.  This proposition is given additional credence if one remembers that this is exactly what happened within the church at Corinth and the one in Thessa- lonica.
    Although all of God’s gifts are infallible, they operate through human vessels who are apt toward fallibility.  One must be spirit ually sensitive in any aspect of mediatorial ministry.
    In consideration of the preceding discussion, we propose that the reactions made by the church in response to counter-balance heresies is one of two primary factors that contributed to the cessation of the spiritual gifts.  Before we entertain the second factor, it is felt that an examination of some writings of the post-apostolic period is pertinent in order to establish the fact that the mirac ulous gifts did not cease with the completed .canon.
    Justin Martyr;  Dialogue with Trypho a Jew. (110-165 A.D.) “...knowing that daily some of you are becoming disciples in the name of Christ, and quitting the path of error; who are also receiv ing gifts, each as he is worthy, illumined through the name of this Christ.  For one receives the spirit of understanding, another of counsel, another of strength, another of healing, another of fore knowledge , another of teaching, and another of the fear of God.” “...for the prophetical giftsremain with us, even to the present time.  And hence you ought to understand that the gifts formerly among your nation have been transferred to us.”
    “...now, it is possible to see amongst us women and men who possess gifts of the Spirit of God.”
    Irenaeus Against Heresies. (120-202 A.D.)
    “...Wherefore, also, those who are in truth His disciples, receiv ing grace from Him, do in His name perform miracles, so as to promote the welfare of other men, according to the gift which each one has received from Him.  For some do certainly and truly drive out devils, so that those who have thus been cleansed from evil spirits frequently believe in Christ.  Others have foreknowledge of
    things to come:  they see visions, and utter prophetic expressions. Others still, heal the sick by laying their hands upon them, and they are made whole.  Yea, moreover, as I have said, the dead even have been raised up, and remained among us for many years.  And what shall I more say?  It is not possible to name the number of the gifts which the church scattered throughout the whole world, has received from God, in the name of Jesus Christ, who was crucified under Pontius Pilate, and which she exerts day by day for the benefit of the Gentiles.”
    “...In like manner we do also hear many brethren in the church, who possess prophetic gifts, and who through the Spirit speak all kinds of languages, and bring to light for the general benefit the hidden things of men, and declare the mysteries of God.” i      As is evident from writings of the early church fathers, the charismata continued to be operative in the early church.  But a closer examination of early church history reveals that they became, for all practical purposes, extinct toward the beginning of the 4 th century.  This brings us to the second proposed factor that contributed to their cessation.
    Under the rule of the Roman Empire, the church went through ten general persecutions beginning with Nero in 64 A.D. and ending with the Emperor Diocletian from 303 A.D. to 313 A.D.  History re cords that this last persecution was the most severe and cruel of any previous reign of terror.  In fact, Diocletian had a. coin struck to commemorate the terminus of Christianity.
    After the death of Diocletian, Constantine became the next Emperor of the Roman Empire.  He allegedly had a conversion exper ience in 312 A.D.  All persecutions ceased with his edict of 313 A.D, In fact, Christianity was then instituted as the new state religion. Some may deem this as a victory for the Christian faith, but in reality, it promoted its apostasy.  Christianity was now in i4fe .vogue.  Pagans by the multiplied thousands went under the name of “Christian”.  McClintock and Strong’s Cyclopedia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Literature has this to say concerning this era:
    “The simplicity of the Gospel was corrupted; pompous rites and ceremonies were introduced; worldly honors were conferred on the teachers of Christianity, and the kingdom
    of Christ in a great measure converted into a kingdom of this world.”
    So, in conclusion, it is seen that the two primary factors which were instrumental in the decline and cessation of the charismata were (1) the Church’s reaction to heresy, and, (2) a world-wide apostasy within the Christian faith.
    Much time has been used to establish the premise that the spirit ual gifts were destined to continue throughout the church age.  This was a necessary foundation since the topic of this paper involves one of the supernatural aspects of God’s graces.
    We will now turn our attention to the second objective of this paper which is an examination of the passages used to support atone ment healing.
    II.  In examining the passages used to support atonement healing, the primary reference which will be quoted is Bodily Healing and the Atonement by Dr. T. J. McCrossan, noted Hebrew and Greek scholar who was the Examiner in Greek for the Presbytery of the Presbyterian church.  This book has been re-edited by Kenneth Hagin and Roy Hicks.
    Although we are primarily concerned with atonement healing, we will nevertheless consider the six arguments for Divine healing which Dr. McCrossan enumerates in his book.  This will be done since most arguments for healing are foundationally predicated upon the atonement healing passage of Isaiah 53.  In this section, we will not attempt to comment on his propositions but will reserve that for the third section of this paper.  For now, we will just present his six reasons why healing is God’s will for us in every case.
    REASON I.  Because God used to heal the sick, and he is an unchangeable God.
    Dr. McCrossan begins by saying that in Old Testament times, God was man’s Healer.
    “...I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee.” (Exo. 15:26)
    “T;.”;and’I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.”
    “Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases.” (Psa. 103:3)
    (10)
    He then finds additional support in the New Testament by emphasizing Jesus’ healing ministry.
    “And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.” (Matt. 9:35)
    “And they went out, and preached that men should repent. And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.” (Mk. 6:12,13)
    It is then reasoned that if God healed in the Old Testament and in the New Testament, then he still heals today, since God does not change.
    “For I am the LORD, I change not...” (Mal. 3:6)
    “Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and forever.” (Heb. 13:8)
    “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.” (James 1:17)
    In that God is immutable, we know that he still heals today because healing is revealed in his name.  God’s power and character is made known to us through his compound names.
    (1) Jehovah-shammah:  “The Lord ever present”
    (2) Jehovah-jireh:  “The Lord our provider”
    (3) Jehovah-nissi:  “The Lord our banner”
    (4) Jehovah-shalorn:  “The Lord our peace”
    (5) Jehovah-raah:  “The Lord my shepherd”
    (6) Jehovah-tsidkenu:  “The Lord our righteousness”
    (7) Jehovah-rapha:   “The Lord that healeth”
    REASON II.  Again, all Christians should expect God to heal their bodies today, because Christ died to atone for our sicknesses as well as for our sins.
    The passage used to support atonement healing is found in Isa. 53:4,5.
    “Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and af flicted.
    But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.”
    If one were to read the Isaiah passage from the King James version, the idea of suffering for the expiation of our sins would seem to be all that was involved.  For instance, within verse 5 there are four phrases that are employed to describe the same action.
    This is known as synonymous parallelism.  Other examples of this may be seen in Gen.2:4; Isa.43:7; and Isa.45:7.  The parallels are wounded-transgressions, bruised-iniquities, chastisement-peace, and stripes-healed.  In the context, the atoning of sins or spiritual healing would appear to be all that is under consideration.
    We will now do a word study to determine whether or not this is in fact the situation.  The Hebrew word for griefs is choli. According to Young ’s Analytical Concordance, choli denotes sickness, weakness and pain.  It is this word which elsewhere in the Old Testament is translated sickness (Deut. 7:15; 28:61; 2Chron.21:15; Isa.38:9).  The Hebrew word translated sorrows is makob.  In Strong’s Exhaustive Concordance, it is given the definition of pain or sorrows, and is translated pain in Job 33:19 and Jer.51:8.  In reference to the word healing (rapha) in verse 5, the Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament says that it means to heal or make healthful. It may refer to the restoration or healing of either the soul or the body.
    Keil and Delitzsch in their erudite Commentary on the Old Test amentgives the following comment on the verses under consideration: “In 4a it is not really sin that is spoken of, but the evil which is consequent upon human sin, although not al ways the direct consequence of the sins of individuals. But in the fact that He was concerned to relieve this evil in all its forms, whenever it came in His way in the exercise of His calling, the relief implied as a consequence in verse 4a was brought distinctly into view...it is evident that both of these are to be understood in the sense of an expiatory bearing, and not merely of taking away...But in the case before us, where it is not the sins, but our diseases and our pains that are the object, this mediatorial sense remains essentially the same.  The meaning is not merely that the Servant of God entered into the fellowship of our sufferings, but that He took upon Himself the sufferings which we had to bear and deserved to bear, and therfore not only took them away, but bore them in His own person, that He might deliver us from them...It was our peace, or, what is more in accordance
    with the full idea of the word, our general well-being
    which these sufferings arrived at and secured...The stripes and weals that were inflicted upon Him have made us sound and well.”
    The Isaiah passage gives a graphic account of the Suffering Messiah and his purpose of reconciliation accomplished at his first advent.  Alexander McLaren, in his Commentary, has this to say a- bout the Isaiah passage:
    “It is to be kept in view, that the griefs, which the Ser vant (Christ) is here described as bearing, are literally sicknesses, and that similarly, the sorrows may be diseases. Matthew in his quotation of this verse (Matt.8:16,17) takes the words to refer to bodily ailments—and that interpre tation is part of the whole truth, for Hebrew thought drew no such sharp line of distinction between diseases of the body and those of the soul, as we are accustomed to draw. All sicknesses was taken to be the consequence of sin.” Dr. McCrossan states that the opponents of atonement healing argue that ‘the prophecy of Isaiah was fulfilled in the day when our Lord healed the great multitude.  It was fulfilled about three years before the Lord died on the cross.  The prophecy of Isaiah was fulfilled in his divine ministry of healing during his first advent and is not applicable for us today 1 .
    In refuting this argument, Dr. McCrossan examines Matt.12:17-21. I will now quote verbatim his rebuttal of this line of reasoning.
    “...Here, then, is a great prediction from Isaiah that in the future, (1) the Gentile nations would yet hear the Gospel and find hope in Christ, and (2) that Christ would yet hurl forth judgment unto victory (referring to His coming in vengeance to destroy all His enemies); and yet—wonderful to narrate—Matthew here declares that this prophecy of Isaiah was then fulfilled, even before the Gentiles had yet heard the Gospel; and he uses the very same word to express this fulfillment that he uses in Matthew 8:17; viz., plerothe, the 1 st aorist passive, subjunctive, 3 rd person singular of the verb pleroo, I fulfill.
    Matthew asserts in Matthew 12:17 that Christ did what He did on this occasion, ‘That it might be fulfilled (plerothe) ,
    which was spoken by Esaias the prophet,’ and he here uses the very same word for ‘fulfill’ (plerothe) that he uses in Matthew 8:17 regarding the fulfillment of Isaiah 53:4. Why did Matthew declare in Matthew 12:17 that this great prophecy of Isaiah 42:1-4 was fulfilled at this time—when it would not be fulfilled ‘until Jesus sets up His eternal kingdom?  Because, from God’s standpoint, it was really fulfilled just as soon as Christ was here on earth, and began His saving ministry.”
    REASON III.  Again, all saints should expect God to heal their sicknesses today, because all sickness is the result of satan’s work, when he introduced sin into this world, and Christ was manifested to destroy satan’s work.
    Dr. McCrossan maintains that Acts 10:38 proves to us conclusively that all the diseases Christ cured while on earth had been caused by satan.
    “God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and
    and with power: who went about doing good, and healing
    all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.”
    The word here for “oppressed” means in the Greek:  “I dominate or exercise lordship over.”  Then all whom Christ healed while on earth were diseased or afflicted because satan had gotten the lordship, either over them or their ancestors.  But Jesus came, died on the cross, and rose again that he might destroy the works of the devil.
    “Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.” (Heb.2:14)
    “...For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.” (lJn.3:8)
    REASON IV.  The fourth reason why all Christians should expect God to heal their sick bodies today is because the very same Holy Spirit who did all of Christ’s miracles and raised Him from the dead i~ still in the Church, and has all His life-giving power.
    In supporting this fourth proposition, Dr. McCrossan engages in a cursory word study in the Greek of four key words found in passages of Scripture which he cites.
    The first word which he stresses is the word “power” (dunamis). Of course, this is a word which is frequently used in the context
    (14)
    of the Holy Spirit’s ministry within the Church.  It is the dunamis of the Spirit which empowers the Christian in his spiritual warfare.
    “For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power ,and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance...” (lThess.l:5)
    “But ye shall receive power., after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you...” (Acts 1:8)
    “For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.” (2Tim.l:7)
    Secondly, he makes a case for the word “infirmities” (astheneiais) found in Rom.8:26.  He emphasizes that the Greek word astheneiais is the commonest word in the Greek language for “sickness”.
    “Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.” (Rom.8:26)
    In fact, the next two words which he enumerates is found in this same verse.  Dr. McCrossan states that the word “quicken” is zgopoiesei. This word is really formed by two Greek words which has the meaning of, “I make life”.  In conjunction with this thought, he says that the word translated “mortal” is thneta.  He insists that this verse does not refer to the bodily resurrection since the Greek word for a dead body is nekros.  He maintains that thneta refers to something which is “subject to death”.  Dr. McCrossan concludes that it is the work of the Spirit to keep making life in our mortal bodies (bodies subject to sickness and death).
    REASON V.  Again, all Christians should believe in divine heal ing today because of:  (a) Christ’s last Great Commission, and (b) God’s direct command in James 5:14.
    “And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.” (Mark 16:17,18)
    “Is any sick among you?  let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:
    And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be for given him.” (James 5:14,15)
    REASON VI.  The sixth and final reason why Christians today should expect God to heal their bodies is because of his marvelous
    (15)
    promises, the fulfillment of which depends altogether upon the exercise of our own faith.
    “Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on
    earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall
    be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.” (Mt.l8:19)
    “And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believ ing, ye shall receive.” (Mt.21:22)
    “For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.
    Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.” (Mk.11:23,24)
    “And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.” (Jn.14:13,14)
    “If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.” (Jn.l5:7)
    “And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.” (Un.3:22)
    “Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.” (3Jn.2)
    III.  The evidence for healing as God’s will in all situations seems to be monumental and very convincing.  But as one views the real world, we are immediately faced with an apparent contradiction to the Word of God.  How can this be so?  It cannot!  Whenever there is a seeming discrepancy in the Word, it is not the Word that is in error but the interpretation of the Word.
    “Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.” (Matt.24:35)
    “...let God be true, but every man a liar.” (Rom.3:4) This dilemma can only be resolved when the theology in question has been revised to measure up to life’s realities and is in accord with Scriptures.  This we will attempt to do.
    To begin with, we will address the arguments for atonement healing as discussed in the previous section of this paper.
    REASON I.  Because God used to heal the sick, and he is an unchangeable God.
    An honest student of the Bible does not question the historicity
    (16)
    and reliability of the healing experiences in the Bible whether it be in the Old Testament or the New Testament.  What is questioned, however, is whether it is God’s purpose and design to heal unequivocally all of the time.
    Any time a theory or theology is absolute in its wording and meaning, then it cannot allow any exceptions.  If any exceptions can be brought to light, then that theory/theology becomes invalid. We will now examine the Scripture to see if there are any examples that would nullify this first proposition.
    (1) The classic example that comes to mind in the Old Testament is that of Job.  Everyone is familiar with the story of Job and the trial he endured.  The fact that the disease and suffering that he encountered was under the direct auspices of God cannot be denied.  Job’s trial served God’s purpose in several ways.  Not only was satan shown that Job, in his free will would serve God without qualification, but the character of Job was also refined.  Job deemed himself a righteous man as a result of his comparison with other men.  It was only as a result of his trial that he saw his real de pravity as he was brought into comparison with the holiness of God. So in this case, we see where sickness/suffering was used to accom plish God’s will.
    (2) One of the greatest patriarchs of faith in the Old Testament was the prophet Elisha.  In 2 Kings 13:14 we read where Elisha had a sickness wherein he died.
    >
    “Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died.  And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over his face, and said, 0 my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.”
    From all accounts, this sickness and Elisha*s resultant death was not because of a lack of faith or of any sin on the prophet’s part, but it was merely the vehicle God used to take him home.
    “Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.” (Psa.116:15)
    (3) We will now discuss one more Old Testament example.  In 1 Kings 14 the narrative describes the events leading up to the death of Jeroboam’s son.  Jeroboam calls for the prophet Ahijah to seek a word from the Lord concerning the sickness of his son.  This is the same Jeroboam, king of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, who
    (17)
    led the people into idolatry by setting up two golden calves, one in Bethel and the other in Dan.  The word that was given from God was that the child shall die.  The point of interest is found in 1 Kings 14:13.
    “And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward the LORD God of Is rael in the house of Jeroboam.”
    What is evident in this passage is that it was God’s will to take the child home.  God saw the purity of the child’s heart and wanted to spare him from being reared in an evil home.  This truth is seen in Isa. 57:1.
    “The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart: and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come. ”
    Another interesting note in this passage is found in 1 Kings 14:4 concerning God’s prophet Ahijah.
    “...But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.”
    Undoubtedly, the prophet Ahijah did not know about “walking in Divine health.”
    (4) Turning now to the New Testament, we will consider Paul’s famous “thorn in the flesh.”  Those who adhere to the atonement healing/Divine health theology will attempt to deny that Paul’s “thorn” was indeed a physical ailment.  We will now focus our attention to this hypothesis.
    The scriptural reference to his “thorn” is found in 2 Cor. 12:7. In order to assertain the basis for his mentioning his “thorn”, we must understand Paul’s logic and reasoning for this discussion.  This actually begins in 2 Cor. 10.  Paul is confronted by opponents in the church at Corinth who promote themselves as apostles and teachers of the Gospel but who are in reality merely false apostles and false teachers.  They are judaizers who are trying to pervert the Gospel of Grace into a gospel of law and one of Jewish legalism.  They rid icule Paul’s physical appearance and even his speaking ability.  This can be seen in 2 Cor. 10:10.
    “For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.”
    In his defense, Paul begins by saying that one is not measured
    (18)
    by the eloquence of his speech or of men’s wisdom, but is measured by God through his acts and deeds.  He then enumerates those things which he has suffered for the Gospel’s sake.
    In relating his heavenly vision, he does so in the third person so as not to elevate himself.  For it was this very reason that the “thorn in the flesh” was given to Paul so that his pride would not be exalted because of the visions which he experienced.
    Since Paul witnessed with his eyes those things which were exclusively reserved for heavenly eyes, we contend that Paul’s “thorn” was possibly a malady afflicting the eyes. While it may not be a malady of the eyes, it is clear from the context and other passages that his infirmity was a bodily ailment which periodically caused him much anguish.
    The word “infirmities” which is found in 2 Cor. 12:5,9,&10 is the Greek word astheneia.  Thayer, in his Greek-English Lexicon, says that astheneia refers to a “want of strength, weakness, infirmity”.  The word may be used in a specific sense such as an illness, sickness, or disease, or, it can be used in a general sense to refer to any type of weakness.  The context must determine the original intent and meaning of the writer.  Here, Paul uses the word in a specific sense.
    Gal.4:13-15 sheds some more light on the subject in question.
    “Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the
    gospel unto you at the first.
    And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not,
    nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as
    Christ Jesus.
    Where is then the blessedness ye spake of?  for I bear
    you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have
    plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.”
    It is evident that Paul experienced some form of physical impairment during his stay in Galatia.  Normally, people would have been repulsed by the sight of his malady, but the Galatians received him as an angel of God.  We will now quote from several other sources in regard to this Galatian passage.
    “He reminds the Galatians that his first preaching to them was unexpected and under adverse circumstances...The natural repulsive-ness of sickness and superstition that the sick are under the disfavor of the gods would seem to indicate that he could not have a hearing among them.  But he preached the gospel to them, they overcame to
    temptation to disbelieve, and they received him as an angel of God,
    (19)
    even as Christ Jesus.” (The Wesleyan Bible Commentary).
    “There seems to have been something repulsive in Paul’s appearance at the time of his first visit to them:  they might well have found it a trial (ton peirasmon humSn means ‘the trial which you experienced’; the variant ton peirasmon mou would mean ‘the trial which I caused’).  Like some of his critical converts in Corinth, they might have said, ‘his bodily presence is weak, and his speech of no account’.  In fact, the Galatians did the opposite of what they might well have been tempted to do:  far from despising Paul because of his bodily condition, they welcomed him and his message with joy. (New International Greek Testament Commentary) .
    “You know that when I preached the gospel to you the first time, I did so in bodily weakness, and you did not feel contempt for my physical condition, which must have been a real trial to you, nor did you show any disgust at it.” (An Expanded Paraphrase of the Epistles of Paul — F.F.Bruce).
    “All that we can get from this statement is the fact that Paul’s preaching to the Galatians ‘the first time 1 or ‘the former time 1 was due to sickness of some kind...In spite of his illness and repulsive appearance, whatever it was.” (Word Pictures in the New Testament — A. T.Robertson).
    In the closing of this letter to the church in Galatia, we find a verse which has sometimes been used to support the theory that Paul suffered an eye disease.  Although not conclusive, it is still worthy of consideration.
    “Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.” (Gal.6:11)
    Normally, Paul dictated his letters to an amanuensis, but here he writes with his own hand in “large letters”.  Some take this to mean that he did this for emphasis, but it is just as reasonable to conclude that he had a tendency to write in large letters as a result of an inflammation of the eyes.  It probably aggravated his eye condition to have to write and that may be the reason why he always dictated his letters.  In disregard of his own inconvenience, he authors this letter to show to the Galatians the urgency which he feels concerning the heresy which certain judaizers have pro mulgated.
    (20)
    One other passage necessitates our examination in regard to Paul having a physical “infirmity”.  This is found in Acts 18:18-21.
    “And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea; for he had a vow.
    And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews. When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;
    But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem; but I will return again unto you, if God will...”
    In these verses, we find that Paul takes a modified Nazirite vow while at Cenchrea.  This was taken in anticipation of the coming feast at Jerusalem.  We will now quote from a few selected writings to help clarify this passage.
    “The Nazirite consecrated himself or herself, and took a vow of separation and self-imposed discipline for the purpose of some special service, and the fact of the vow was indicated by special signs of abstinence...It was clearly a Nazirite’s vow which Paul took, ‘having shorn his head in Cenchrea’ (Acts 18:18), and which he completed at Jerusalem with other Christians similarly placed (Acts21:23).” (The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia).
    “The shaving of the head normally came at the termination of the period of the vow (Acts 21:24), but here it seems to have taken place at the beginning.  A passage in Josephus throws light on this. Describing the rites of purification undertaken by Queen Bernice, which occurred about a decade later than the present incident, the historian says, ‘She was visiting Jerusalem to discharge a vow to God; for it is customary for those suffering from illness or other affliction to make a vow to abstain from wine and to shave their heads during the thirty days preceding that on which they must offer sacrifices’ ...” (ACTS; The Expanding Church —E.F.Harrison).
    “Most likely the passover, at which he wished to attend for the purpose of seeing many of his friends, and having the most favourable opportunity to preach the Gospel to thousands who would attend at Jerusalem on that occasion.” (Clarke’s Commentary).
    From the information gleaned from the Corinthian, Galatian, and Acts passages, it can be reasonably inferred that Paul did indeed
    suffer from some kind of physical ailment.
    (5) Another New Testament example that contradicts the proposition that God heals without exception is the young evangelist, Timothy.  Paul, in the Pastoral epistle of 1 Tim.5:23, admonishes Timothy to ‘Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thine often infirmities. ’
    Ronald Ward, in his Commentary on 1&2 Timothy & Titus, gives an accurate comment on this verse:  “The operative word is stomach, which is no more than a transliteration from the Greek.  It was taken over into Latin, where a ‘good stomach’ means a good digestion. As a deponent verb (stomachari) it is used in the sense of ‘to be peevish, out of humor, to fume,’ and it can mean ‘to quarrel with. 1 As Timothy had weighty responsibilities on his hands he would have to guard against dyspeptic choler and the possibility of losing his temper and starting a quarrel.  Paul’s robust commonsense is here united with his spirituality.  Take a little remedy; the water may be impure anyway.  The quanity advocated is small and the reason is clearly stated.”
    (6) Phil.2:25-27 provides us with still another exception to the stated proposition.
    “Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants. For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick. For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.”
    Paul states that it was only because of the mercy of God that Epaphroditus’ life was spared.  As to the cause of the illness, J.B. Lightfoot, in his St.Paul’s Epistle to the Philippians, suggests a very probable reason:  “Not content with placing this token of their love in Paul’s hands, Epaphroditus devoted himself heart and soul to the ministry under the Apostle’s guidance.  But the strain of excessive exertion was too great for his physical powers.  In his intense devotion to the work he lost his health and almost his life. At length the danger passed away...But his convalescence was succeeded by home-sickness.  He was oppressed with the thought that the Philippians would have heard of his critical state.  He was anxious to return that he might quiet their alarm.”
    (22)
    (7) While it may be countered that Epaphroditus was eventually healed, the fate of Trophimus cannot be likewise answered.
    “Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.” (2Tim.4:20)
    The only fact that can be definitively assertained is that Trophimus was sick and that Paul had to leave him in that condition in order to continue his missionary travels.
    (8) The last New Testament passage which would be applicable to the present topic is found in ICor.11:29-34.
    “For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and
    drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s
    body.
    For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and
    many sleep.
    For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
    But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that
    we should not be condemned with the world.
    Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat,
    tarry one for another.
    And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come
    not together unto condemnation.  And the rest will I set
    in order when I come.
    The Corinthians had completely forgotten the true purpose of the Lord’s supper which Paul had previously explained to them. They had changed its memorable significance to that of a gluttonous, drunken festivity.  Paul, in verse 29, tells the Corinthians that they were partaking of the Lord’s supper unworthily (“in an unfit manner”—Thayer) by not discerning (“to separate, make a distinction, discriminate”—Thayer) the Lord’s body.  Consequently, God was chastening (“instruct by discipline”—Strong) them by allowing weakness, sickness, and even death to come to them.
    The foregoing argument was not to refute the stated proposition that “Because God used to heal the sick, and he is an unchangeable God”, but rather, the refutation is to the extenuating conclusion drawn from the proposition.  It is undeniably true that God’s mir acle working power is transcendent in time, hut it is also true that God’s sovereigntypervades time, space, and history to ulti mately perform his will.  The variables which are inherent within the healing question are myriad and complex.
    We will now consider the second reason that Dr. McCrossan gives why healing is God’s will for us in every case.
    (23)
    REASON II.  Again, all Christians should expect God to heal their bodies today, because Christ died to atone for our sicknesses as well as for our sins.
    As has been previously stated, the foundational passage for atonement healing is found in Isa.53:4,5.
    “Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and af flicted.
    But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.”
    Again, we would like to reiterate that we agree that the word ing in this passage definitely includes healing of our bodies as part of the vicarious suffering of Christ.  But the disparity is in the interpretation as to when this will be consummated.
    We would first like to consider how the New Testament writers interpreted this Isaiah text.  These cited passages are found in Matt.8:16,17 and lPet.2:24.
    “When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick: That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.”
    “Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.”
    Matthew quotes the prophecy of Isaiah and finds its fulfillment in the healing ministry of Jesus.  While some may say that the fulfillment was before Calvary and hence is not a part of the atonement, this does not do justice to the original thought in the Hebrew text.  Everything that Jesus did and taught was in view of the Cross.  For example, Jesus could offer eternal life to those of his day and reconcile them to God eventhough the price of Calvary had not yet been paid because the factof Calvary was accomplished already in the mind of Christ.  John 5:24,25 brings this truth into light.
    “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.
    Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.”
    (24)
    Turning now to the verse in iPeter, we find that the emphasis of the phrase “by whose stripes ye were healed” is upon spiritual healing and not to physical healing.  Again, we must stress the fact that although in this instance the Apostle is only stressing one aspect of the atonement, it does not negate other mediatorial aspects of the Cross, namely our physical healing.
    We will now try to reconcile the conflict which one is faced with if atonement healing is believed and yet realizes that healing may not always be within the scope and plan of God.  The present writer feels that the healing ministry and deliverance ministry that Jesus had during his first advent was for the primary purpose of proving his Messiahship.
    “But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.” (Jn.5:36)
    “If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.” “But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works; that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.” (Jn.10:37,38)
    “Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works’ sake.” (Jn.l4:ll)
    “And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book.” “But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye m-icfht have life through his name.” (Jn.20:30,31)
    Those who insist that believer’s should walk in Divine health and not experience any disease or sickness are not consistent with their theology when it comes to such mundane diseases/illnesses as tooth decay, baldness, poor vision, the common cold, acne, etc. These, too, fall under the redemptive power of Christ according to Scripture.
    “He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning.   For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.” (Uohn 3:8)
    But the ultimate fulfillment will not be realized until the Second Advent.  Paul, in his letter to the Romans, affirms this truth.
    “For we know that the whole creation groaneth and tra-vaileth in pain together until now.
    And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even i*e ourselves groan with in ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the re demption of our body.” (Rom.8:22,23)
    (25)
    REASON III.  Again, all saints should expect God to heal their sicknesses today, because all sickness is the result of satan’s work, when he introduced sin into this world, and Christ was mani fested to destroy satan’s work.
    The reasoning behind the response to this proposition is parallel to that of the previous argument.  That is, it is not questioned that Christ did indeed conquer satan on the Cross, but again the disparity is to whenthe total redemption from the curse of the fall will be realized.
    It has been said by the advocates of atonement healing that it is not God’s will for any of his saints to die of diseases.  God’s elect should only die from “natural causes”, excluding martyrdom of course.  What they fail to realize is that “natural causes” are a result of the fall and, consequently, are the works of satan.  The dying process is a degenerative process which was instituted by God as judgment for man’s sin.  Even science recognizes this degenerative process within the universe and has termed it entropy, a fund amental factor of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
    In the study of the aging process, known as gerontology, scientists distinguish between two types of aging.   Primary aging, also called senescence, includes the unavoidable changes in the structure and composition of the body that are determined by heredity.  Second ary aging, or senility, includes disabilities caused by illness or accidental damage.
    The point of the matter is that even those walking in “Divine health” are suffering from the curse of the fall eventhough Christ indubitably was manifested to destroy satan’s work.  We, as the Bible declares, are “appointed once to die and after that the judgment”.  Paul, writing to the Corinthians, states that our bodies are sown into corruption.  It is the very nature of man.  This is a constant.  The only variable is what “vehicle” God chooses to terminate our earthly life, whether by primary aging or secondary aging. This may seem fatalistic, but it is nevertheless a fact of nature and the law of God.
    Christians should not despair, however, because our hope is not of this world.  And in times of sickness it is the Father’s will that we come to him and ask for our healing and according to his sovereign will and purpose, he will answer.
    (26)
    REASON IV.  A fourth reason why all Christians should expect God to heal their sick bodies today is because the very same Holy Spirit who did all of Christ’s miracles and raised Him from the dead is still in the Church, and has all His old-time, life-giving power.
    In his fourth reason why all Christians should expect God to heal their sick bodies today, Dr. McCrossan finds his support in the Greek text of four words translated from the Textus Receptus (KJV) .  These are power (dunamis) , inf irmi-ties (astheneiais) , quicken (zoopeiesei) , and mortal (thneta).
    In order to “rightly divide the Word”, one must be totally objective in his study and in the interpretative process.  We must not start with our interpretation and then go to the Word to find support for it.  We must first go to God’s Word and objectively study it and then assertain its revealed truth.
    Although Dr. McCrossan was correct in his arguments for the words power and mortal, the present writer feels that he was in error in his arguments for the words infirmities and quicken.  To justify this statement, a few principles of hermeneutics (science of interpretation) must be considered.   First, in any study of Scripture, the Rule of Definition must be used.  This simply means that one begins with a study of words, defines the terms employed, and then retains those terms defined.   Secondly, the Rule of Context must be adhered to.  This means that a word or thought must be interpreted in the immediate text of Scripture in which it is used since that determines the point and force which the writer had in mind.  What is important, however, is that these two rules do not act independently of each other.  Whenever a word may have two or more meanings, then its contextwill determine the true import of that word within the immediate text.  This is the critical point of interpretation which Dr. McCrossan failed to perceive.
    For example, he stressed that the Greek word astheneia is the most common word in the Greek language for “sickness”.  In his at-temp to find evidence for his proposition, Dr. McCrossan neglected, either deliberately or otherwise, to explain to the readers that astheneia refers to weakness/infirmity of either body or soul.

    That being the case, we must now go back to the passage of Scripture at hand (Rom.8:26) and reconsider the word “infirmities” within its context.  Paul states that the Spirit comes to our aid in regard to our infirmities (weaknesses).  He then says that “we know not what we should pray for”.  Now, if the word “infirmities” used here should mean bodily sicknesses, then this phrase would not make much sense.  If one were to have a disease of sickness of some kind, then it would be obvious that he would know what to pray to God about.  That of course would be healing of his body.   But if Paul used this word to refer to weaknesses of the soul (weaknesses of the human nature), then it would make better sense.  Truly, the Scripture is correct when it says:
    “The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?” (Jere.l7:9)
    It would be apropos to consider a view passages of Scripture where the Greek word astheneia is used in the sense of weakness of the human nature.
    “Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness. 1 (Rom.6:16,19)
    It is evident from these verses, and especially from the entire thought of Rom.6, that Paul utilizes the word astheneia in the light of weakness of the soul (human nature).
    “We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.” (Rom.15:1)
    Here, Paul says that we strong Christians (strong in the law of liberty which is in Christ) should bear (have consideration of) the “infirmities” (astheneia) of the weak, that is, those weak Christians mentioned in Rom.14.
    “For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;
    Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself. For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.” (Heb.7:26-28)
    (28)
    The writer of Hebrews makes a comparison between the priesthood of Christ and the Levitical priesthood.  In verse 28 the writer says that the law made men high priests which had infirmity (astheneia) . Of course, we know that according to the Mosaic law that a man could notbecome a priest if he had any kind of disease (infirmity).  Consequently, it becomes evident that the writer of Hebrews is saying that the Levitical priests were men who were subject to sin because of the weakness (infirmity) of their human nature.  But the Son (Christ) is consecrated (perfected) forever.  Jesus was that sinless sacrifice who became our High Priest (Intercessor) forever.
    We would now like to examine the word quicken (zoopoiesei) . This Greek word comes from the root word zoe.  The other two Greek ‘words which are translated “life” are bios and psuche.  Dr. McCrossan states that the word “quicken” (zoopoiesei) has the meaning of, “I make life”.  He then concludes that it is the work of the Spirit to keep making life in our mortal bodies (bodies subject to sickness and death).
    The obvious fallacy in such a conclusion would be that the Holy Spirit fails in his work of “continuing to make life” in the phys ical body since we all ultimately die.
    This erroneous conclusion by Dr. McCrossan is due to the fact that he fails to distinguish between the kind of life which the Spirit continually generates.  The words bios and psuche* are syn onymous in meaning and refers to biological, animal life.  Whereas, the Greek word zoedenotes the “God kind of life”.  The zoe life has reference to the “quality” of life that a Christian is given and also refers to the “existence” of that life as it relates to its eternal attribute.  Of the 171 times that “life” is translated in the New Testament, 125 times it is translated from the Greek word z3e.  And in every instance it refers to that life which is spiritual in nature.
    REASON V.  Again, all Christians should believe in Divine heal ing today because of:  (a) Christ’s last Great Commission, and (b) God’s direct command in James 5:14.
    Since Dr. McCrossan does not employ the absolute terminology in this proposition, we have no disparity in thought.  However, we would like to give further attention to the word “anoint” found in
    the James passage.
    (29)
    Most commentators, in their attempt to minimize the miraculous aspect of God’s grace, accentuate the nuances of meaning between the Greek word used in this passage (aleipho) and the other Greek word (chrio) which is elsewhere translated “anoint”.  They maintain that chrio is always used in the context of a ceremonial anointing, whereas, aleipho means to smear or rub and is used in the context of a medicinal or therapeutic use.  Since they deny that God still heals today, they argue that the command to pray for the sick is without basis and is not applicable to present day Christian theology.
    Admittedly, there is a miniscule difference in meaning between aleiphoand chrio.  However, this difference is not in their application or usage but the difference is contingent upon the agent that administers the oil.  Whether or not the more mundane word aleipho is used or the more sublime word chrio is used is entirely predicated upon the sublimity of the agent.
    In order to demonstrate the validity of this statement, a brief word study utilizing Young’s Analytical Concordance will now be given.
    Aleipho
    Mt.6:17 “thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head”-disciples Mk.6:13 “anointed with oil many that were sick”-disciples Mk.l6:l “that they might come and anoint him”-women Lk.7:38 “kissed his feet, and anointed (them) with”-a woman Lk.7:46 “thou didst not anoint...hath anointed”-Simon; a woman Jn.ll:2 “It was (that) Mary which anointedthe”-Mary Jn.l2:3 “anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his”-Mary Jas.5:14 “anointing him with oil in the name of”-elders
    Chrio, epichrio, egchrio
    Lk.4:18 “he hath anointed me to preach the”-Spirit of the Lord Acts 4:27 “child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed”-the Father Acts 10:38 “How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with”-God 2Cor.l:21 “he which...hath anointed us, (is) God”-God Heb.l:9 “thy God, hath anointed thee with the”-God Jn.9:6 “he anointed the eyes of the blind man with”-Jesus Jn.9:ll “A man that is called Jesus...anointed mine”-Jesus Rev.3:18 “anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou”-Jesus
    By making a notation to the right of each scripture reference as to who performed the anointing, it becomes evident that every- time a man or woman does theianointing.,;uthfen the more mundane word aleipho is used.  Conversely, when Deity does the anointing, then the more sublime word chrio is used.
    (30)
    REASON VI.  The sixth and final reason why Christians today should expect God to heal their bodies is because of his marvelous promises, the fulfillment of which depends altogether upon the exer cise of our own faith.
    In responding to this final reason, we will examine the seven scriptural promises which were cited under this sixth reason in the second section of this paper.  These prayer promises are usually quoted without qualification and are normally considered uncondi tional (faith being the only condition).
    1.  “Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.”
    In order to correctly interpret a passage of scripture, it is imperativethat the passage under consideration be initially examined within its immediate context.  This is a basic principle of good hermeneutics.  And this is the premise which we will adhere to in reviewing these seven scriptural promises.
    The primary thought in the Matt.18:19 context is that of Church organization and discipline.  This is readily seen when one reads the instructions given concerning the obstinate person referred to in verses 15-17.  In verse 18, we find the phrase “to bind and to loose”.  This phrase was a common Hebrew idiom meaning to prohibit and to permit.  When Jesus gave this power to the apostles, he meant that whatsoever they forbade in the church should have Divine author ity; whatever they permitted, or commanded, should also have Divine authority.  In verse 19, we find that there is not need of the whole to give validity to the apostolic authority granted in verse 18.
    When two of you agree, or have the same mind, feelings, and opinion, about the arrangement of affairs in the church, or about things desired for its welfare, and shall ask of God, it shall be done for them.  See Acts 1:14-26; 15:1-29.  The promise here has res pect to the apostles in organizing the church.  It cannot with any propriety be applied to the ordinary prayers of believers (Barnes* Notes) .
    The rest of the chapter concerns itself with the idea of being forgiving and merciful.  Unlike the obstinate brother in the preceding verses, this brother comes and asks forgiveness, hence, the theme of Church demeanor is still in view.
    The following promises will be considered together since there are certain conditions, whether explicitly or implicitly stated, which have commonality to all.
    “And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, be lieving, ye shall receive.” (Mt.21:22)
    “Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.” (Mk.ll:24)
    “And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my ‘name, I will do it.” (Jn.14:13,14)
    “If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.” (Jn.l5:7)
    “And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.”TlJn.3:22)
    AS one begins his search for Truth buried within the pages of Holy Writ, his humanity and finiteness abruptly comes into focus when confronted with the unfathomable depths of God’s wisdom.  God revealed this truth to the prophet Isaiah when he said:
    “For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.” (Isa.55:9)
    With this attitude and perspective ever reminding us that “we see through a glass, darkly”, we will now attempt to discern the intricacies of prayer.  The elements of prayer which this writer will highlight are not definitive, but merely suggestive and intro ductory to the multi-faceted aspect of God’s will.
    There are seven;:fundamental essentials of prayer that must be appropriated before our petitions will be answered.
    1.)  The first prerequisite for answered prayer is that the petitioner must have a clean heart before God.  His life and conduct must be exemplary.  That is not to say that he does not sin, but it intimates that there is a constancy about his walk with God.  Just as soon as he falls into sin, he is immediately convicted in his heart and expresses sincere remorse before God and finds solace and total remission in the blood of Jesus.  He is continually submitting the totality of his being to become fashioned and formed into the image of the Son of God.  The very force which gives him impetus is that desire to do God’s will.
    (32)
    What has thus been described may seem idealistic and untenable, nonetheless, it is the expectation and will of the Father.  To the degree that we thus fulfill the Father’s will, to that same degree will we receive those requests we ask of the Father.
    While our vertical relationship with God is important, it is not altogether exclusive.  The Bible also damands that our horizontal relationship with our fellow man be in harmony.  In fact, the so-called unconditional promise of Mk.ll:24 has within its context a definite stipulation.
    “And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought a- gainst any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.
    But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.” (Mk.ll:25,26)
    The Scriptures are replete with verses which declare to us the veracity of this vertical-horizontal relationship which God has, in his omniscience and Divine will, ordained every Believer to emulate. The apostle John, in his first epistle, brings this thought succinct ly into perspective.
    “If we say that we have fellowship with him (God) , and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth: But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.” (lJn.l:6,7)
    2.)  The second prerequisite for answered prayer is the desire, motive, will that prompts the prayer must be in accord with the will of the Father.  It was curiously evident to this writer as he read the “prayer promises” cited by Dr. McCrossan that one notable promise was not cited.  This promise is found in iJohn 5:14,15.
    “And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us: And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.”
    The wording found in this passage is very much akin to that found in the other “promises” except for the “according to his will” clause.  This is one factor of good hermeneutics that many students of the Bible neglect to perceive, namely, that isolated passages may or may not cite the qualifications or conditions upon which that promise is contingent, but only after evaluating all related passages does one receive the whole truth and concept that is being expressed.
    (33)
    From the study of the Bible, we find that there are essential ly three elements of “God’s will” as it relates to man.
    First, we know that it is “God’s will” that mankind be redeemed back to God.  This is known as the Doctrine of Justification.
    “And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have ever lasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.” (Jn.6:40)
    “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.” (Rom.5:1)
    “The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.” (2Pet.3:9)
    Secondly, we know that it is “God’s will” for all Christians to take on the nature of Christ.  That is, we should strive to walk in love and holiness.  This is known as the Doctrine of Sanctifica- tion.  Sanctification is that work of God in the Believer, through the Spirit and the Word, which changes him into the image of Christ progressively.
    “For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.” (Rom.8:29)
    “For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication.” (lThess.4:3)
    Permit us to digress for a moment and comment on the topic of predestination as found Rom.8:29.  This area of discussion has proven to be the source for much confusion and controversy.  To those who are of the hyper-Calvinistic persuasion, predestination means that all men are predestined before they are even born whether they will spend eternity in heaven or hell.  They have no choice in the matter; it is entirely resolved within the absolute sovereignty of God.
    What the Scripture really teaches, however, is that God predestinates/wills for all Christians to be conformed to the image of h:3 Son.  The Word does not teach that we are predestined either to heaven or hell.  That thought is not even within the context of the passage in question.  The thought is simple and straight-forward, namely, that the ministry of the Holy Spirit is to sanctify and to work in bringing about the unity of the nature of the Christian with
    (34)
    the nature of Christ.
    When the Bible declares that God predestines something or wills something, he never does so against the free will of man.  For example, when the Word states that God is “not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance” , it does not teach that all men will ultimately be saved.  It simply means that God yearns for this to occur, but will not violate the very laws that he established in regard to man.  When we read in Genesis that God cre ated man “in his own image”, one facet of .that image was free or sov ereign will.  Consequently, he will not violate his own creative law.
    Within this same thought, one should interpret Rom.8:29 in ref erence to predestination.  God will use every circumstance for the purpose of developing this conformation of the Believer.  God’s will for our lives will be realized only to the degree in which we submit our will to his.
    Returning now to our discussion of “God’s will”, we will now consider the third element.  The first two elements primarily focused on the individual Believer:  (1) God’s will for his initial salvation (Justification), and (2) God’s will in maturing him into the image of Christ (Sanctification).  The third element, however, concerns it self with the individual Believer in relation to the corporate Church.
    In other words, God does not view the individual Christian as a lone entity, but incorporates him into the Divine scope and plan of the entire Body of Christ.  Since we are all members of the same Body (!Cor.l2:12), it is of primary importance as to the future ac-tions of the individual members.  This can be seen in the following verses.
    “Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.” (Rom.1:10)
    “That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.” (Rom.15:32)
    “But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord wilJ, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.” (lCor.4:19)
    “For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.” (Jas.4:15)
    In Acts 16:6, we read where Paul was forbidden by the Spirit to go into Asia to preach the Gospel.  This was not because God did not
    (35)
    want the people in the province of Asia to be saved, but it just was not in God’s timing and Divine plan at this time.  Paul there upon decided to go to the province of Bithynia, once again the Holy Spirit forbade him to go.  It was at this time that he received the “Macedonian call”, a definite Divine directive.  We can not begin to understand the reasons for this, but it can be inferred that in some way the prospect of the future body of believers was in the Mind of God.  Who can fathom the wisdom of God?
    We engaged in this short study of “God’s will” with the purpose of better understanding the “according to his will” clause found in IJohn 5:14.  This restriction must be read in conjunction with the “what things soever ye desire” phrase in Mark 11:24.  This paradox is resolved when read in the light of Rom.8:27.
    “And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God. ”
    This verse declares that God, who searches the hearts, hears the intercessory prayer of the Spirit who always prays according to the will of God.  How does the Spirit pray for the Believer? When the Believer completely yields his will to God, then (and only then) can the Spirit come to our aid and begin to direct our prayers so that they will in fact be in accordance with the will of God.  As we begin to “walk in Christ”, then our “desires” will also be the “desires” of the Spirit because we are allowing ourselves to become “new creatures in Christ Jesus” (2Cor.5:17).
    3.) The third prerequisite for answered prayer is that we ask “in his (Jesus) name”.  This phrase carries with it several different meanings.  To help clarify the import of this phrase, we will note a few passages of scripture where this phrase is recorded.
    “He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward...” (Mt.10:41)
    “And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.” (Col.3:17)
    Most commentators agree that to “receive a prophet in the name of a prophet” means to receive that prophet himself.  This thought is expressed in Mt.25:34-40.
    “Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for
    (36)
    you from the foundation of the world:
    For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty,
    and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:
    Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me:
    I was in prison, and ye came unto me.
    Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when
    saw we thee an hungered, and fed thee?  or thirsty, and
    gave thee drink?
    When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked,
    and clothed thee?
    Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?
    And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say
    unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least
    of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.”
    The teaching in this passage is in harmony with the teaching found in Mt.lO:41. Jesus says that when we do these things in his name, we are doing them as unto Christ himself.
    The phrase, in the name of Jesus, points to and emphasizes the Personof Christ and his ministry of reconciliation.  So, when the Bible commands us to do all things (word or deed) in the name of the Lord Jesus, it teaches that whatever we do in the kingdom of Christ, we do it for the edification and glory and honor of the Person of Christ.
    This writer feels that too often people use this phrase almost as a magical quote thinking that there is power in the words themselves.  The power is resident in the work and ministry of Christ and to the motive/purpose in which the Believer utilizes these words. In Acts 19:13-17, we read of the seven sons of Sceva who tried to use this phrase upon a demoniac.  Since they were not followers of Christ, they had no authority or right in invoking the name of Christ. Consequently, the demoniac overcame them to their wounding.
    Therefore, when we make our petitions known to God asking in the name of Jesus, it must be with the purpose of ultimately edify ing the Person of Christ.
    “The name of a person can only be used when we seek to enforce
    his will and further his interests.  This gives the condition
    of successful prayer:  it must be for the furtherance of Christ’s
    kingdom.” (Expositor’s Greek Testament)
    Too many times our prayers are selfish and not Christ-centered.  This becomes especially evident in the “prosperity theology” popularly being proclaimed in our churches today.
    (37)
    4.)  The fourth prerequisite for answered prayer is having that very essential element of faith.         * 
    “Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not...it shall be done.” (Mt.21:21)
    “Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” (Heb.lltl)
    “But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering...” (Jas.l:6) The teaching of faith is much like other teachings within the Christian church, it is either stressed too much or too little. It is either to the far right of the scales of truth or to the far left.  The atonement healing advocates teach it to the point of not considering other conditions of prayer.  On the other hand, those -who are opposed to Divine healing, neglect its pertinence and use the escape clause of “if it be God’s will,” never really putting their faith “on the line”.  Although there is truth in this statement, there is error in the statement found in Dr. Hagin’s and Dr. Hicks’ addenda notes in the book, Bodily Healing and the Atonement;
    “When Bible teachers assert that all true prayer must include the proviso, ‘if it be thy will,’ what will such teachers do with God’s own declaration in Isaiah 45:11?  ‘For thus saith the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel...enquire of me concern ing my sons, and concerning the works of my hands command me 1 (Septuagint) .
    “Is man the work of God’s hands?  Yes.  Then God here says, ‘Concerning the works of my hands command me 1 ?  One thing is certain, Isaiah 45:11 can never mean anything to the timid saint who always prays with the proviso ‘if it be thy will’. Such persons will never even desire sufficient faith to act as God commands all His saints to act in Isaiah 45:11. ” In light of the reproof in vss. 9&10 and in view of the interpretation given to the context by Paul in Rom.9:20,21, the truer sense of the passage should be read thus:
    “Do you question me concerning things to come?  and am I bound to give you an account?  And concerning my children, even concerning the work of my hands, will you command me, or prescribe to me? Dare you do so?  Shall any teach God knowledge, or give law to him? Those that complain to God do in effect assume authority over him.”
    (38)
    5.)  The fifth prerequisite for answered prayer is compassion. This is the heartbeat of God.  When we pray for someone who is sick, we must truly have compassion and empathy for them.
    “So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they fol lowed him.” (Mt.20:34)
    “And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.”
    (Mk.1:41)
    “And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.
    And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak.  And he delivered him to his mother.” (Lk.7:13,15)
    6.)  The sixth prerequisite for answered prayer is importunity. Importunity entails an evincing earnestness, a faith that takes no denial, and especially a perseverance that continues to intercede until the request is granted.
    “And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;
    For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?
    And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.
    I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.” (Lk.ll:5-8)
    (See Luke 18:1-5 as another example of importunity.)
    7.)  The seventh prerequisite for answered prayer is unity. This element is necessary when there are two or more praying together. This is the prayer of Jesus in John 17:22 when he said:  “that they may be one, even as we are one.” When there is unity of purpose a- mong believers, then we are fulfilling God’s will.
    “These all continued with one accord in prayer...”  (Actsl:14)
    “And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.”  (Acts2:l)
    “And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple...” (Acts 2:46)
    “And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord...”  (Acts 4:24)
    “And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and won ders wrought among the people; and they were all with one accord in Solomon’s porch.”  (Acts 5:12)
    (39)
    We will now make one final comment in regard to the cited “promises” enumerated in Dr. McCrossan’s sixth reason why all Christian’s should expect God to heal them without fail.  This last promise is found in 3John 2.
    “Beloved, 1^ wish above all things that thou mayest pros per and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.”
    To take this verse and dogmaticly assert that it expresses God’s will is contrary to all accepted rules of hermeneutics.  It is presumptuous, indeed, to declare that the wish and desire of the apostle as it relates to the health and welfare of one, Gaius, is in actuality the expressed will of God.  The simple truth of the matter is that this is nothing more than a common salutatory address. “It is customary in Ist-century letters to have a prayer at the beginning.  Now John prays that Gaius’s affairs may prosper in the same way as his soul does.” (The New Bible Commentary) Conclusion.
    For sake of brevity and clarity, the recapitulatory segment of this paper will only address the primary objectives that the writer hoped to convey.
    (1)  In the discussion of healing, it was deemed necessary to begin by establishing the premise that the charismatic gifts named in ICor.12-14 were destined to continue throughout the Church Age. This was necessary since healing, by its very nature, belongs in the miraculous realm of God’s grace.  The proof of this premise was sought, first, from an examination of the scriptural text and, sec ondly, from a historical perspective.
    The writer then proposed to the reader two possible explanations why the charismata eventually ceased to operate within the Christian faith.  These were:  (a) the Church’s reaction to heresy, and, (b) a world-wide apostasy within the Church.
    (2)  In the second section of this paper, we attempted to present the reasons adduced ir Dr. McCrossan’s book, Bodily Healing and the Atonement, why it was God’s will to heal in every case. This was hopefully done in a fair and objective manner.
    (3)  The final portion of this paper readdressed the reasons cited by Dr. McCrossan, and reconsidered them in light of good, biblical hermeneutics.  Because there are irrefutable cases where some did not receive their healing, the writer endeavored to demonstrate that it was not because God failed in his promises, but the fault
    lies with improperly interpreting God’s Word.
    Although this paper does not claim to be definitive, it is hoped that it will bring about a balanced theology between the atonement healing advocates and those who completely deny that God still heals today. While the writer unreservedly believes that God still mani fests his healing power today, he cautions other Christians to acknow ledge the sovereignty of God in all things, healing included.  We must guard ourselves from becoming dogmatic and closed-minded. Dogma tism tends to perpetuate ignorance.
    It is the prayer of the writer that this paper would be read and studied with an objective and unbiased attitude.  The readers are admonished to be like the Berean Christians in Acts 17 and to “search the scriptures to see whether these things be so”.

    Women’s Adornment
    - a Biblical Perspective
    Today’s society has often been referred to as the “Permissive Society”.  Permissiveness is evident in child-rearing, the judicial system, academic standards, and in morality.  While in times past, the theme of a movie or novel might be “romance”, now it is “sex”.
    The Church, regrettably, has not been left untainted with this moral laxity.  We are graduating from our seminaries those who deny the very fundamentals of Christianity:  the virgin birth, the blood atonement, the deity of Christ, a bodily resurrection, and the divine inspiration of scripture.
    The Body of Christ has been divided into liberals and conservatives While some churches allow almost any type of behavior and manner of life among its followers, there are other churches which demand a most rigid lifestyle.
    This paper addresses itself to this latter group.  The adherents of this group believes that Christians should look different from the “world”; they teach that God’s people are a “peculiar people” (Tit.2:14; 1 Pet.2:9).  The two Greek words translated in the KJV for “peculiar” actually means a “private possession”.
    In considering their stance, we will deal with their “proof-texts” as regards women’s apparel, jewelry, hair, and the use of make-up. In exegeting these passages, we will follow the accepted principles of hermeneutics. thereby presenting a balanced biblical perspective. An addendum of the Rules of Interpretation will be attached at the end of this paper.
    Women’s Apparel
    “The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman’s garment; for all that do so are abomination unto the LORD thy God.” (Deut.22:5)
    From this single passage, it has been taught that the Bible forbids women from wearing any type of pants whatsoever.  It will be demonstrated that this interpretation violates most of the eight Rules of Interpretation cited within this paper.
    First of all, if one is to properly interpret this passage correctly, then it must be considered in the light of its context.  This passage is part of Moses’ farewell address.  God has already told Moses that Ee\will not be permitted to enter Canaan, but is allowed to view it from the heights of Mount Pisgah. Moses then instructs and admon ishes the people to be faithful to Jehovah and not to be defiled by the practices and beliefs of the inhabitants of the land in which they are about to enter.
    Next, we would like to do a word study of some of the key words within this verse.  In using Young’s Analytical Concordance and Strong’s Exhaustive Concordance, it was found that there are eight Hebrew words (with root variations) which are translated “man” in the KJV.
    adam - man, mankind
    ish - man, husband, individual
    enosh - man, mortal
    baal - owner, master, lord
    geber - a mighty man, warrior, soldier
    zakar - male
    nephesh - a soul, breathing creature
    echad - one
    (2)
    Beside each of these Hebrew words you will see its definition or
    appropriate meaning as given by most scholars of the Hebrew language,
    such as Benjamin Davidson in his Hebrew and Chaldee Lexicon.  The particular
    Hebrew word used in Deut. 22:5 is the word “geber”.  In the over 2,400
    instances in which the above Hebrew words are translated man, geber is
    used in over 80 of these translations and it is always in the context
    of a mighty man, warrior, or soldier.
    With this in mind, let’s now turn our attention to the word “abomination”.  The Hebrew word for abomination is “toebah”.  In the Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament, the writers state that the word “toebah” denotes an abomination that may be of a physical, ritual, or ethical nature and may be abhorred by God or man.  The word “abomination” is commonly linked with idolatrous worship (Deut. 7:25; 12:31; 13:14; 18:12; 27:15; etc.).   The Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament further states that “toebah” is used as a synonym for “idol”, as in Isa. 44:19, or even for a specific pagan deity, as in II Kings 23:13 where Milcom is called “the abomination of the Ammonites,” parallel to-“Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians” and “Chemosh the abomination of Moab”.
    In the International Standard Bible Encyclopaedia, it is noted that “not only the heathen idol itself, but anything offered to or associated with the idol, all the paraphernalia of the forbidden cult, was called an “abomination”, for it “is an abomination to Jehovah Thy God” (Deut. 7:25,26).
    With the information already discussed and a proper understanding of the historical and cultural background of this passage, it will be seen that this verse refers to cultic transvestism.  That is, men would dress as women and women as men in worshipping heathen gods.
    (3)
    Adam Clarke in his scholarly commentary stated “we know that in the worship of Venus, to which that of Astarte or Ashtaroth among the Ca-naanites bore a striking resemblance, the women were accustomed to ap pear in armour before her.  It certainly cannot mean a simple change in dress, whereby the men might pass for women, and vice versa.” Ashtaroth was not only the goddess of fertility but was also the patroness of war.  The following is an excerpt from Hasting*s Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics:  “From antiquity, says Plutarch, on the island of Cos, the priest of Heracles wore women’s clothes when offering sacrifices In Rome, men who took part in the vernal mysteries dressed as women... Men wore the clothing of women when they presented themselves before the Star of Mars; and women wore men’s armor when presenting themselves before the Star of Venus.  Idols were frequently represented with the features of one sex and the dress of the other....Priests of Astarte, after castration, assumed female attire.”
    After studying the context, doing a word study, and researching the historical and cultural background of this verse, it becomes ap parent that Moses was warning the people not to participate in the Canaanite idolatrous rituals.  Probably the practice of sex perversion and homosexuality, particularly in connection with pagan worship of fertility gods, accentuated the need of this warning to the Hebrew people.
    Let’s further examine this passage.  Although the foregoing explanation may or nay not be convincing enough, there are still other points to be considered.  To begin with a study of clothing during that period of Israel’s history would be appropriate.  According to James Hasting’s Dictionary of the New Testament and the International Standard Bible Encyclopaedia, the ancient oriental dress consisted of
    (4)
    an under garment and an outer garment.  The inner garment initially consisted of a loin-cloth or girdle, this was later replaced by what is known as the “shirt”.  The shirt resembled the Roman “tunic”. The outer garment was a loose robe, or a large square piece of cloth, like a modern shawl, which could be wrapped around the person, with more or less taste and comfort.  Merrill F. Unger in his linger’ s Bible Dictionary states that “the difference between the dress of men and women was small, consisting chiefly in the fineness of the mater ials and the length of the garment.”  So it can be seen that in ancient times, the garments worn by both male and female resembled the modern day “dress” worn by women.  It certainly does not teach against the wearing of “pants” by women.  Just because a garment is a two-legged garment doesn’t necessarily make it “men’s apparel”.
    Let’s now consider another point as it relates to Deut.22:5.  If
    *
    one is to make a doctrine of this one verse, then, in order to be consistent, one must also make a doctrine of the remaining verses of this passage.  For instance, according to Deut.22:8, all construction of new homes should be made with a battlement or guard-rail on the roof of the house.  The next verse teaches us that when we plant a garden, it must he planted with just one type of plant per garden. Furthermore, if someone teaches it to be a sin to wear pants, then k they must also teach it a sin to wear permanent press clothes, e.g., ^ clothes with 50% polyester and 50% cotton.  This rule is found in
    Deut.22:ll where it states “Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers Inserts, as of woolen and linen together.” This line of reasoning may ftf-seem rather comical and bordering on the ridiculous, but it is valid reasoning nonetheless.
    CS)
    Considering all that has been said, it stands to reason and good biblical hermeneutics that the interpretation of Deut.22:5 refers to cultic transvestism and is not proclaiming that it’s wrong for a woman to wear pants.
    Much of the following summary is taken from Ralph Woodrow’s book Women’s Adornment:  What Does The Bible Really Say?
    The Bible does not give an inflexible or uniform clothing code. It does not specify any certain color, style, or material.  The Bible does teach, however, that women should “adorn themselves in modest ap parel” (1 Tim.2:9).  Some churches teach that a woman must always wear long sleeves so that her elbows are covered.  We feel that most sane men would not be sexually aroused over the sight of elbows.  One pastor commented:  “Why do those who insist that knees and elbows must be covered at all times do not require a face covering also? After all, would not a pretty face be more attractive and appealing than a pair of knees or elbows?” Although we believe in standards of decency, we are adamantly opposed to extremism.
    What might be proper or practical clothing in Hawaii, would be impractical and out of place in Alaska.  What one might wear to work in the yard would not generally be what he would wear to church.  The legalist fails to admit that circumstances alter cases.
    Some feel that if a doctrine is not harsh and strict, it is not the “old-time religion”.  But a study of Acts 15 shows that the Apostles were against imposing rules on the people that God has not placed on them.  By this decision, they were not “lowering their standards” nor did it indicate any spiritual laxness on their part.

    Jewelry
    In this study, we will first examine those New Testament passages which make reference to jewelry.  After studying the passages found in the New Testament, we will then turn our attention to those verses found in the Old Testament.
    “Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.”  (1 Pet.3:3,4).
    This passage is often used in the support of the doctrine that it’s wrong to wear jewelry.  But even a cursory reading of the text shows that this is not the case.  For example, in verse 3, if it teaches that it is a sin to wear gold/jewelry, then it’s also a sin to wear clothes (putting on of apparel).  A simple understanding of the Hebrew idiom used in this passage will help to understand what the writer is saying.  In case the reader is not familiar with the definition of an idiom, we will briefly define it and will give a few illustrations. An idiom is an expression peculiar to a particular language or nation ality.  There are several different types of idioms used in the Bible. We will illustrate only three of these types.  First of all, an idiom may be used as an anthropomorphism, that is, it speaks of God as having human form or human feelings.  Examples of this type of Hebrew idiom is found in Gen.6:6; Jef.26:12,13; and Jon.3:10.  Commenting on Gen.6:6, Keil and Delitzsch in their famous Commentary on the Old Testament,states “The repentance of God is an anthropomorphic expres sion for the pain of the divine love at the sin of man...”, Another type of idiom is known as a relative for absolute.  This is merely a type of comparison.  Examples of this are found in Luke 11:31,32; Heb.l:4; and Heb.3:3.  The type of idiom that we see used in 1 Pet.3:3,4
    (7)
    is known as an absolute for relative.  This type of idiom is a manner of speaking which would minimize a first clause in order to emphasize a second clause, or vice versa.  Today, in order to express the thought contained in this type of idiom, we would place the word “only” in the first clause, and “also” (or perhaps “rather”) in the second clause. By being cognizant of this particular Hebraism we could paraphrase the passage in question as follows:  “Whose adorning let it not be (only) that outward adorning...; But (also) let it be the hidden man of the heart...”.  With this idiom, the emphasis is on the second clause, but it does not do away with the first clause.  It is in addition to it. To further illustrate this, we will consider a few more .New Test- ment and Old Testament passages where this idiom is employed.  Let’s first examine John 6:27.
    “Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you:  for him hath God the Father sealed.”
    Adam Clarke in his commentary states:  “Labour not for the meat-That is, for that only, but also for the bread...Our Lord wills every man to be active and diligent in that employment in which providence has placed him; but it is his will also that that employment, and all the concerns of life, should be subservient to the interest of his soul.” Another example of this Hebrew idiom is found in John 12:44.
    “Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.”
    A.T.Robertson in his Word Pictures in the New Testament says regarding this verse:  “Not on me only, but also on” another example of exaggerated contrast.
    Another example of this idiom will be illustrated from a passage in the Old Testament.
    (8)
    ”So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God:  and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a’ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.”  (Gen.45:8).
    It is obvious from reading the story of Joseph that his brothers did indeed sell him to the Ishmeelites with the intent of his being exiled to Egypt.  But in this verse Joseph is minimizing this fact and emphasizing the fact that God was in providential control.  Other examples of this idiom may be found in Mk.9:37; Acts 5:4; Gen.32:28; Ex.16:2; 1 Sam.8:7; and 1 Tim.2:9.  This last passage (1 Tim.2:9) is the other “proof-text” used to support the doctrine that prohibits the wearing of jewelry.  In this verse, the writer is emphasizing the first clause and minimizing the second clause.  Here again, Paul is instructing the women to concentrate on the inner qualities and to not be so concerned with the outward appearance.  The Old Testament “proof- text” is found in Isa.3:18-25.
    “In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the moon,
    The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers, The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings, The rings, and nose jewels,
    The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins,
    The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails. And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty. Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.”
    Before explaining this passage, we will give a brief historical background of ornaments and their part in the oriental culture.   Smith’s Bible Dictionary gives us the following information regarding ornaments:  “The number, variety and weight of the ornaments ordinarily worn upon the person form one of the characteristic features of Oriental costume, in both ancient and modern times.... There is sufficient
    (9)
    evidence in the Bible that the inhabitants of Palestine were equally devoted to finery....Eliezer decorated Rebekah with a golden nose-ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold.  Gen.24:22. Earrings were worn by Jacob’s wives. Gen.35:4.”
    In the Davis Dictionary of the Bible, a similar account is given: “Orientals adorn themselves with ornaments to an extent deemed excessive by occidental taste.  It has ever been so.  Hebrews, Egyptians, Midian- ites, Syrians, both men and women, were fond of wearing ornaments (Gen.24:22; Ex.3:22; 11:2; 32:2; Num.31:50)... It was a national custom with the ^shmaelites for the men to wear earrings (Judg.8:25,26), and men among the Hebrews sometimes did so (Ex.32:2).”
    This information seems to be in conflict with what is taught in Isa.3:18-25, but after considering the context of this passage, we find that this is not the case at all.  Isaiah was a prophet of the Southern Kingdom,Judah, at the time the Northern Kingdom, Israel, was destroyed by the Assyrians in 721/722 B.C.  The period of his active ministry may be placed at about 750-680 B.C.  The time that this particular passage was penned was probably during the reign of Ahaz (736-716 B.C.). It was a dark hour for the nation of Judah because she was following in the same footsteps as did her sister to the north, Israel.  Judah prided herself with the riches that she had and not giving glory and ,honor to Jehovah from whom those blessings came.  Judah had sunk so far in idolatrous worship that she even began to sacrifice her little
    “ones to the god Molech.  It was because of her sins that God instruct-
    i
    ed the prophet to take away the jewelry from the people. The jewelry ^symbolized and represented God’s blessings upon Judah. By taking the Jewelry away, God was, in effect, removing his favor and gracefrom
    Judah.
    flO)
    In his book Bible History: Old Testament. Alfred Edersheim re-
    marks about this period of Jewish history:  “If has previously been stated that this was the flourishing period of prophetism in Israel. This perhaps the more, because now the last warning voices were raised among a people sunk in idolatry and corruption, and nigh to judgment... But here also, alike owing to increasing prosperity and to success, ‘pride’ and its resultant vices, soon became apparent.... In vain did the prophets call to repentance; in vain did they speak of nearing judgement; in vain seek to woo by promises of mercy.  Priests and people boasted in an outward and formal observance of ritual ordinances, as if these were the Substance of religion, and in this trust set lightly by the warning of the prophets...”
    To further illustrate that the jewelry represented God’s blessings on Israel, we would like to consider another passage of scripture. This passage will be taken from the book of Ezekiel.  Ezekiel, you will recall, was also a prophet to the Southern Kingdom, Judah.  Ezekiel was one of the first to go into Babylonian captivity during the second deportation of 597 B.C.
    “I clothed thee with broidered work, and shod thee with badger’s skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk.
    I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.  And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thine head.  Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil; and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom.
    And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty:
    for it was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon
    thee, saith the Lord GOD.”  (Eze. 16:10-14).
    As can be easily discerned, it was Jehovah who adorned the Israelites with their beautiful ornaments, signifying his blessings and favor upon them. A thorough examination of the entire chapter better illuminates the message that God was speaking to his people.  The Interpreter’s Commentary on the Bible gives the following synopsis of this chapter in Ezekiel:  “Here is a long poem on the history of Jerusalem, presented in allegorical form. For Jerusalem really to perceive the nature of her sins she must see them against the back ground of—all the wonderful things God has done for her in the past..., In allegorical terms she is described as born of an Amorite father and a Hittite mother who, rather than give her the care proper for a newly born infant, abandons her in an open field....  Seeing the infant Jerusalem in her helpless and impure state, Yahweh says:  “Live, and grow up like a plant of the field....  Yahweh sees that the young lady is now grown and enters into a marriage covenant with her....   The adornment, beauty, and renown of the city reached a climax in the time of Solomon. ... As a wife Jerusalem turns to adultery and becomes a harlot....  None of Jerusalem’s jealous lovers among the nations can count on her fidelity, for she has played off one against the other. Hence they will at last assemble against her and strip her of her clothes, i.e. wealth, and leave her na?3d and bare as she was at first....”
    From this study, it has been shown that the prohibition of jewelry is not taught anywhere in the Bible, either Old Testament or
    (12)
    .New Testament. The basis for this teaching has been constructed on perfunctory interpretative skills. It is a superficial exegesis of isolated passages with no thought as to its historical and cultural context.
    (13)
    Hair
    “But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dis-honoureth his head.
    But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head:  for that is even all one as if she were shaven.
    For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered. For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man. Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man. For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.
    Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.
    For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God.
    Judge in yourselves:  is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?
    Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?
    But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given her for a covering.
    But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.” (1 Cor.11:3-16).
    To properly understand what the Apostle Paul is instructing the church at Corinth, a verse-by-verse commentary of this passage is re quired^  This we will endeavor to do.  But before this is done, we would like to highlight two terms found in this passage—veil and hair. This will be done by presenting to the reader the customs and signif icance of both terms as found from a variety of reference works.  The need for this should be obvious to the reader.  Since there is a vast disparity of time, space, and culture between the readers of the
    Corinthian letter of Paul’s day and the readers of that same letter
    «
    today, then a familiarization of some aspects of the culture of that period is necessitated.  We will do this by reproducing excerpts from different selections without commenting on them.
    (14)
    Veil.
    Manners and Customs of the Bible.  “Kitto supposes the vail to have been a kind of head vail which ladies wear at home, and which, not being intended for concealment of the features, rests upon the head and falls down over the back.  It is of very light texture, being usually a long strip of muslim embroidered with threads of colored silk and gold, forming altogether one of the most graceful articles in the female attire of the East.”
    The International Standard Bible Encyclopaedia.  “The use of the face veil as a regular article of dress was unknown to the Hebrew woman. The modern oriental custom of veiling is due to Mohammedan influence and has not been universally adopted by Jewesses in the Orient.  In Mew Testament times, however, among both Greeks and Romans, refutable women wore a veil in public and to appear without it was an act of bravado (or worse).”
    Smith’s Bible Dictionary.  “Much of the scrupulousness in respect of the use of the veil dates from the promulgation of the Koran, which forbade women appearing unveiled except in the presence of their nearest relative.  In ancient times the veil was adopted only in exceptional cases, either as an article of ornamental dress, or by betrothed maidens in the presence of their future husbands.” Hair.
    The Bible Almanac.  “The Hebrew men cut their hair much as modern Western men do, using a primitive kind of scissors....When a Jewish man made a religious vow, he did not cut his hair...The Israelites were not to shave their hair so closely that they resembled heathen gods who had shaved heads...The women wore their hair long and braided. The Talmud mentions that Jewish women used combs and hairpins.”
    (IS)
    linger*s Bible Dictionary.  “The Hebrews bestowed special care on the hair and beard; regarding thick, abundant hair as an ornament.  Long flowing hair was worn only by the young men in more ancient times, and by Nazarites during the term of their vow.”
    Hasting’s Dictionary of the New Testament.  “By primitive and ancient; peoples in general, the hair is regarded as a special center of vitality, and to this belief the various forms of the hair-offering are ultimately due.  Examples of this practice are afforded by St. Paul’s vow, according to which he cut off his hair at Cenchreae (Acts 18:18), and by the similar vows of the four men at Jerusalem, whose expenses St. Paul paid as an evidence of his Jewish piety (Acts 21:24).  These are to be explained from the Nazarite vow of the Old Testament (Num. 6).”
    At this time, we will give a verse-by-verse exegesis of this controversial passage.  This will be accomplished by providing to the reader the most accepted and probable interpretation given by most Bible commentators.
    11:5 But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.
    1. Head  (Gr. kephale); the head; or symbolically, anything supreme, chief, or prominent.   Thayer’s Greek-English Lexicon.
    2. Christ is the Head or Author of this religion.  The man also is the lord or head of the woman; and the head or Lord of Christ, as Mediator between God and man, is God the Father.   Clarke’s Commentary.
    11:4 Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.
    1. Head covered.  This refers to the ‘Tallith 1 which was placed upon the worshipper’s head at his entrance into the synagogue. The Romans, like the Jews, prayed with the head veiled.  The Greeks remained

    2. Dishonoureth her head.  That is, her husband.  In Paul’s day this meant she repudiated his authority.  For a woman in Corinth to be unveiled in public was as shocking in its social significance as being shaven, the contemporary punishment for a prostitute.   The New Bible Commentary-Guthrie.

    11:16 But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.
    1. Custom.  Not the custom of contentiousness, but that of women speaking unveiled.  The testimonies of Tertullian and Chrysostom show that these injunctions of Paul prevailed in the churches.  In the sculptures of the catacombs the women have a close-fitting headdress, while the men have the hair short.   Word Studies in the New Testament-Vincent.
    Although the exegetical form of interpretation is a bit tiring, it was deemed necessary in that it is more thorough and, hopefully, more conclusive. A brief synopsis, or paraphrase of this passage in question will now be given.
    At the onset, Paul establishes the created order as proof that
    woman should give proper and due respect and honor to her husband.  He
    } then says that by removing the veil- a symbol of her subjection to
    her husband- she not only brings disgrace to herself by suggesting by ‘ this act that she is a loose woman, but she also shows contempt and disrespect to her husband.
    Paul again appeals to the created order.  Next, his argument is based on Nature. He only uses hair as an object lesson. He shows by analogythat Nature gives woman the long hair as a covering, thereby enforcing his argument for the veil.  He is not teaching that a woman should not cut her hair in this passage; the question at hand is the veil, not hair.
    The length of hair does not prove one holy or unholy.  In Lk.7:36-50 we read of a sinful woman who washed Jesus’ feet with her tears, anointed them, then dried them with her long hair.  The custom of that time was for women to have long hair.  It did not portray one’s righteousness.
    f God does now as he did then- he looks upon the heart (intents) and not the outside of man.
    The question of whether or not to cut one’s hair is of significance to many Christians. Although it is a belief held in much earnestness and sincerity, it is based on a superficial reading of scriptures with out taking the cultural, historical, and grammatical context into consideration.
    Moreover, a student of the Bible must never build a doctrine from just one passage of scripture.  This has been done oftentimes by various denominations and has proven to be the “vehicle” that brings division to the Body of Christ.
    The one thing taught in this passage that transcends time and culture is the created order: man is preeminent over woman, not in in nate qualities, but in existence.  God willed that man was to rule over the woman, not in tyranny, but out of love. The veil was but a temporary accouterment of the mores of that society.

    Cosmetics
    This last discussion will be taken, in its entirety, from Ralph Woodrow’s book Women’s Adornment:  What does the Bible really say? His article is reproduced in this paper because of its succinctness and brevity; also because his approach is akin to that of the writer.
    The usual argument against make-up, especially lipstick, is based on the verse which says that Jezebel painted her face.  “And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window” (2 Kings 9:30).
    It should be pointed out, first of all, that the portion of her face which she painted was the area around her eyes.  The word here translated “face” is the common word for eyes.  About 589 times it is translated eye or eyes in the Bible.  The marginal rendering of this verse says:  “...put her eyes in painting”; Goodspeed:  “She painted her eyelashes”; Moffatt:  “...painting her eyes”; Lamsa:  “She painted her eyelids with kohl”; Amplified:  “She painted her eyes”.  There is no doubt about it.  The portion of the face that Jezebel painted was the area around her eyes.
    Strangely enough, there are Christian women who use mascara on their eyes, but would not think of using lipstick on their lips--- because Jezebel painted her face!  They do not realize, apparently, that the specific part of the face that Jezebel painted was her eyes.
    Jerusalem ’s unfaithfulness to God was sometimes likened to a woman who was unfaithful to her husband.  The message of the prophets was that even though she made herself fair, her lovers would turn against her and she would be judged.  In such a context the following verses were given:
    “Ye have sent for men to come from far...and, lo, they came:  for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself
    with ornaments” (Ezekiel 23:40).  And, “Though thou clothest thyself with crimsom, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face (eyes) with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise thee, they will seek thy life” (Jer.4:30).
    These two verses, along with the one about Jezebel, have been quoted by those who oppose the use of make-up.  However, the painting of the eyes was a common custom of the time.  Other practices mentioned in these verses were equally common and unquestioned.  In the case of Jezebel, we read that she “painted her face (eyes), and tired her hair, and looked out at a window.” She “tired”, that is, attired her hair. Some take this to mean that she combed her hair; others that she put on some type of hat.  As far as we would know from this verse, if painting her eyes was a sin, then so was combing her hair or putting on a hat!  Obviously, true doctrines or standards cannot be built on inci dental statements such as these. ;    Before the woman mentioned in Ezekiel painted her eyes, she took
    *ra bath.  If painting the eyes is a sin because it rs mentioned in this
    |
    I’verse, then we could just as logically conclude that taking a bath
    ^might be a sin also.  The woman mentioned in Jeremiah painted her eyes
    I
    land clothed herself with crimson.  But even the wearing of crimson, in
    ffr . ^MHH^^WHIIM*!^
    iltself, cannot have a bad meaning.  The “virtuous woman” of Prov.31:21
    if
    Iclothed her household in scarlet (crimson).
    I   Let us reason together.
    r
    I    Would the fact that Proverbs 7:17 mentions a harlot using perfume
    m
    |prove that all women who use perfume are harlots? Or because an es-
    Iteemed woman such as Esther was bathed and perfumed for one year
    it
    IfEsther 2:12,13)--would this mean that women today should go to this
    K
    lextreme?    Would the  fact that an unfaithful wife wore jewelry  (Hosea 2:13),
    prove that all women who wear jewelry are unfaithful? Of course not. On the same basis, then, the fact that three scattered’references to women painting their eyes (along with such things as taking a bath, fixing their hair, or putting on clothing) cannot prove that the use of cosmetics is wrong.  It is the motive, the attitude, the intention of the heart that can make such “fixing up” right or wrong.
    Women darkened their eyebrows, lashes, and the edges of the eye lids in order to make the white of the eyes look larger. Clarke’s Commentary (Vol.4,p.35; Vol.2,p.513) states:  “This fashion seems to have prevailed very generally among the Eastern people in ancient times; and they retain the very same to this day...This staining of the eyes with stibium...was a universal custom.”
    Job named one of his daughters Keren-happuch (Job 42:14), a name which seems to have a definite connection with the use of stibium on the eyes.   Pake’s Annotated Reference Bible points out that the name refers to a vessel made of horn, wherein Oriental women kept the paint used about their eyes to make them appear large and beautiful. The Critical and Experimental Commentary gives her name the meaning of “horn of stibium”; Peloubet’s Bible Dictionary, “horn of antimony”; Young’s Analytical Concordance, “horn for paint”; Stong’s Concordance defines it as “horn of cosmetic”.
    The point is obvious.  If the use of eye makeup was considered a bad practice, righteous Job would not have given this name to his daughter!  Job’s daughters were given names with good meanings.  One was called Jemima, meaning fair as the day, a dove.  The second, Kezia or Cassia, a highly cherished and fragrant spice of antiquity.  The third, Keren-happuch, a name linked with what was considered a sign of beauty, the painting of the eyes.  All of Job’s daughters no doubt used
    (24)
    make-up on their eyes.  Did this make them a disgrace to their father or did this make them ugly by Bible standards? No.  The Bible says: “In all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren” (Job 42:15)
    In the scholarly work, Encyclopedia Judaica (Vol.5,p.978), we read that “cosmetics, for the care and adornment of the body, were widely used by both men and women in the ancient Near East...Women used preparations to beautify the hair, to color eyelids, face, and lips... Women commonly put color around their eyes...Lips were colored with a cream made from oil combined with red ocher, and nails were painted with pigments mixed in ash or beeswax.”
    Camphire, mentioned in the Song of Solomon (1:14; 4:13) and identified as henna (Strong’s Concordance) , provided a much used reddish-orange dye.  Concerning this, the Encyclopedia Judaica (Vol.8,p.327) says: “Throughout the ages the peoples of the East prized this beautiful, fast dye which was used for dying the hair and nails.” Henna was also used on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.
    Make-up has often been helpful in hiding blemishes and scars, and to improve the natural beauty.  Dry skin, dull eyes, and pale lips have depressed many women and given them feelings of inferiority.  The use of lipstick in hospitals has often proved to be a tonic in itself. Generally speaking, when a woman looks better, she feels better.  Insisting that a woman must look dull does not cause her to have a cheer- . ful mind or happy disposition.
    Churches which have put too much emphasis on their doctrine of “no make-up” have caused a lot of undue misunderstanding. A woman, having accepted Christ, may be told:  “Now you are a Christian.  You must take off your make-up.  You don’t want to be like Jezebel who painted her face.” As a result, she may lose all pride in her outward
    (25) appearance, believing that the plainer she looks the more holy she is. Her husband and children may tell her she would look better with some make-up.  But she will not listen.  She mistakenly believes God wants her to look dull.
    Some have opposed the use of make-up on the basis that it is decoration.  But what is wrong with decoration? Wearing a dress with pretty colors might be considered decoration.  Joseph had a coat of many colors.  Was this wrong? The idea that any decoration is wrong has led to some foolish extremes.  Some groups wear only dark clothing. In one such group, the people were told to paint the grills and bumpers of their cars black!  Chrome, they reasoned, was too flashy for God.
    We wonder where men ever got the idea that God wanted people to look drab.  Nature is not this way.  Suppose God had not included color in nature.  Suppose the grass, trees, mountains, sunsets, lakes, and oceans were without color!  Imagine orchids, lilies, violets, poppies, and roses without color!  The garments of the high priest were bright and flashy.  The temple was decorated with gold.  The “New Jerusalem” is described as having all sorts of dazzling stones and jewels.  The extreme view that God requires a dull appearance is certainly not consistent with the over-all teaching of the Bible.

    Conclusion
    In this paper, we have tried to maintain a sound and biblical approach to some contemporary issues as regards women’s adornments. Although we feel that the Church should establish certain guidelines in relation to common decency and modesty, we must be certain that our basis is from solid, biblical principles and teachings.  We must be cautious not to teach the “traditions of. men”.  The Apostle Paul gave some sagacious advice to the Corinthians when he wrote:  “And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things (1 Cor.9:25).
    In concluding, the writer will end with an excerpt from the Introduction of Bob Buess’ book The Pendulum Swings.
    “In this day men and women are hungry for truth.  People are hungry for good teaching. -Sometimes people pursue a line of thought that the Holy Spirit quickened to them as they studied the scriptures. With the excitement of this new thought, they set out to explore the Word of God to see what can be found.  When they find a few scriptures to support this new found idea, if they aren’t careful, they soon find themselves running madly through the Bible trying to prove their theory.
    Dogmatism is beginning to set in on them. Without fully realizing it, they are jumping verses, throwing out some scriptures, and ignoring others to prove their points.
    The purpose of this book is to cause people to slow down and look at the other side of different issues.  It is to let the pendulum swing back into the perfect will of God rather than to be hung up in dogmas and legalism.  It is to call for a re-examination of present studies from a non-partisan viewpoint.  Examine these teachings as an indepen dent judge would do.
    (27)
    The Galatian letter dealt with folks who were leaving the simplicity of the gospel and reverting to rules and regulations.  A subtle spirit is working in the body of Christ today, causing men to revert to the Galatian spirit. They are legalistic in their approach to the Word. They are becoming hard and dogmatic in dealing with truth and with people.”

    PREDESTINATION RECONSIDERED
    The controversy over predestination versus free-will has continued since the early centuries of Christianity.  The Church Fathers, such as, Justin Martyr, Tertullian, Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and Chrysostom, all in clear and decisive statements, gave their adherence to the theory of conditional predestination, rejecting the opposite as false, dangerous, and utterly subversive of the divine glory.
    Augustine was the first prominent teacher of unconditional election, and he, regardless of the logical inconsistency, granted that reprobation is not unconditional.  This doctrine of Augustine was first formally accepted by the Church in 529 A.D., in the Canons of the Council of Orange, approved by Pope Boniface II.  The prominency of unconditional election in the theology of Protestanism is due largely to the influence and work of John Calvin, who, at the age of twenty-five, wrote his Institutes, in which he not only set forth the Augustinian doctrine of unconditional e- lection, but also taught unconditional reprobation.
    John Wesley and his followers were responsible in a large degree for reviving and developing the doctrine of Arminius.  Calvinists hold that the election of individuals to salvation is absolute, unconditional, by virtue of an eternal divine decree.  Arminians regard election as conditional upon repentance and faith; the decree of God is that all who truly repent of their sins and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ shall be saved.  But every responsible person determines for himself whether or not he will repent and believe.
    The controversy surrounding, the doctrine of predestination principally is based upon two passages of scripture:  Rom. 8:29,30 and Eph.l:5,ll,
    (1)
    In trying to ascertain the truth about predestination, I’m reminded of Paul’s statement concerning the “simplicity” of the Gospel message. Too often, in our effort to dissect the Scriptures for further examination, we make our specimens too small.  It is almost like taking a frag ment of a brick and examining it for the purpose of determining the de sign and type of structure of the building in which the brick was removed. Theologians, oftentimes, in their zeal for detailed exegesis, can not “see the forest for the trees”.
    I’m afraid that we have been guilty in the past of not considering Romans 8:29,30 in its fuller context.  When I read any of Paul’s writings, I am mindful of the man and his calling.  In Acts 9:15 the Lord declared to Ananias the calling of Paul:  “Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles...”.  In Acts 13:46-48, Paul acknowledges his calling to the Gentiles.
    “Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles. For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.
    And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.”
    (Our predestinarian friends would like to point out the word “ordained” in verse 48 in support of their view.  However, in the Greek text it is seen that ordained is used proleptically, that is, in anticipation of the verbal action of believed.  For example, when we say, “he was shot dead”, dead is used proleptically in anticipation of him being shot.)
    It is established, then, that Paul was called to be the Apostle to the Gentiles.  Bearing this in mind, we will now consider the dominant theme of the Epistle to the Romans.  Chapters 1-11 primarily deal with the theme of “salvation by faith”.  Chapters 12-16 concerns it-
    (2)
    self with “Christian duties”.  Although the first eleven chapters speak
    *
    of “salvation by faith”, there is a further dichotomy between Law and Grace and between Gentile and Jew.  The point of the message remains the same, however.
    The Church in Rome was composed mostly with Gentiles (Romans) and, of course, with a few Jews.  We conclude this, since the Jews were ex pelled from Rome by Claudius’ edict in 49 A.D., and the Epistle of Romans was written approximately 57 A.D.  These Jews were a constant problem to Paul.  They were known as Judaizers since they insisted on the Gentile converts adhering to certain Jewish laws.  It is for this very reason why this letter was written.
    Paul goes through much effort in establishing the call of the Gentiles to the Gospel.  He takes great pains to prove that the Gentiles are just as much sons of God as the Jews.
    In the first chapter of Romans, Paul declares that “obedience to the faith” is “among all nations (Gentiles)”.  He further states speci fically that the Romans are “the called” of Jesus Christ.  In verse 16, he proclaims the universality of the Gospel by the use of the phrase “to every one that believeth”.  There are no stipulations.  In that same verse, Paul uses a phrase that is strictly Pauline, and that is, “to the Jew first, and also to the Greek (Gentile)”.  He uses this phrase repeatedly in his writings to show that the Gentiles are just as much “called” to be recipients of the Gospel message as the Jews.
    In Romans 2. Paul criticizes the Jews (verse 4) because they were indignant over the fact that the Gentiles were being received as heirs of salvation equally with the Jews.  They were boasting of their heritage and making judgmental and condescending remarks to the Gentile believers.  This statement is validated when interpreted in light of
    (3)
    the rest of the chapter.
    “Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God lead- eth thee to repentance?
    ...But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile; ...Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God.
    ...Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?
    For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you (Jew), as it is written.
    ...For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.”
    Paul, more or less, puts this boasting to rest in chapter 3 when he tells those Jews that they were just as much sinners as the Gentiles eventhough they had the law committed to them.  Paul shows that the Old Testament privileges, though giving to the Jews a certain superiority over the Gentiles, did not give them any advantages in escaping the Di vine condemnation.
    “What then?  are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;”
    He concludes (vss.27,29) that the Jews are without basis to boast since God is a God both to the Jews and to the Gentiles.
    “Where is boasting then?  It is excluded.  By what law?  of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.
    ...Is he the God of the Jews only?  is he not also of the Gentiles?Yes, of the Gentiles also:”
    Paul continues with this same thought in chapter 4 when he proves that Abraham was not only the father of the Jews (and that only of the believing Jew), but he was also the father of the Gentiles.
    “...but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all.
    (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.” (vss.16,17)
    (4)
    There is a play on words in verse 17 thereby expressing a double meaning of thought.  The Jews frequently referred to the Gentiles as “things which be not” and to themselves as “things which be”.  Observe the similar wording and thought as found in 1 Cor.1:28:
    “And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are;”
    Paul addresses the Gentile believers in chapter 5 and 6 assuring them that they are fully justified before God because of the provision of Christ.  He admonishes them to walk in the light of the Gospel and not according to their former way of life.
    In chapter 7, Paul turns his attention to the Jewish believers. He explicitly states this in the first verse where he says, “Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law)”.  Paul proves that the law was but for a season.  They were “bound” to it until it became “dead” (vs.24).  The law ceased with the coming of Christ.  Now, we should live under the law of liberty in Christ.
    The problem at Rome was that the Judaizers were condemning (8:1) the Gentile believers because they did not regard the Jewish laws such as circumcision (Rom.2:28,29), eating unclean animals (Rom.14:14), and observing the Sabbath and other feast days (Rom.14:5).  Paul, in order to abort this false teaching, established the calling of the Gentiles, proved to the Jewish believers that the law was fulfilled in Christ, and firmly maintained the equality of all believers both Jew and Gentile.
    Paul continues his thesis in chapter 8 stating that the law is dead and, consequently, there is no condemnation to those who are in Christ (whether Jew or Gentile).  He admonishes the Jews, and to those Gentiles who were being persuaded by this Jewish heresy, that as long as they put their confidence in Jewish circumcision (see Phil.3:3), then they will never be able to please God (vs.8).  Paul further declares

    that they have been freed from the law (spirit of bondage—vs.15), and have received the Spirit of adoption by their faith in Christ.
    Paul has almost the identical message when writing to the Church in Galatia in order to combat this same Jewish heresy.
    “But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, To redeem them (Jews) that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.
    And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.
    Howbeit then, when ye (Gentiles) knew not God, ye did ser vice unto them which by nature are no gods. But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage? (Gal.4:4-9)
    It is clear in this passage that this heresy was affecting both the Jewish and Gentile believer.  Paul reproves the Jews (vs.5) for becoming again enslaved under the law.  In verse 8, he tells the Gentile believers that they are, in effect, guilty of returning to idolatry by enslaving themselves in these Jewish laws.
    Starting with verse 17, Paul begins a discussion about the consequence of becoming a Christian.  He does so by introducing the cross of the Christian, namely, suffering.
    “And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.
    For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be re vealed in us.” (Rom.8:17,18)
    This was not something foreign to the believers at this time, however, as is evident from this passage and Paul’s own testimony in 2 Cor.11:23- 33.
    There were some in Galatia that were even reverting back to Juda ism during periods of persecution as is recorded in Gal.6:12.
    “...they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.”
    (6)
    Jesus warned the apostles that by following him they would become a reproach unto the world, and consequently, would suffer persecution.
    “These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.” (Jn.l6:33)
    We will now consider a passage found in Romans 8 which has great ly been misinterpreted and misunderstood by many students of the Bible.
    “And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.” (Rom.8:28)
    Many people interpret this to mean that every circumstance in life, whether good or evil (from a human perspective), originates from the predetermined will of God.  This, however, was not Paul’s intention nor his theological position.  When Paul uses the phrase “all things”, he does so in the context of what he had previously discussed, namely, suffering (persecution/tribulation).  In verse 18, Paul says that the sufferings which the Christian endures is completely overshadowed by the hope of the Believer of eternal life with Christ.  Paul further clarifies the phrase, “all things”, in verses 35-39.
    “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?  shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
    As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
    For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
    Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”
    Instead of God being the causative agent for the Believer’s suffering, Paul declares that God’s eternal purpose is not thwarted by these events.  On the contrary, the Christian remains firmly secure in the hope of eternal life.  Because of the tribulations in this world, Paul
    (7)
    writes to the Corinthians in 1 Cor.15:19 that, “If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.”
    This truth can be further illustrated by considering 2 Cor.4:6-18.
    “For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowl edge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the ex cellency of the power may be of God, and not of us. We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;
    Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. For we which live are alwa3y delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.
    So then death worketh in us, but life in you. We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also be lieve, and therefore speak;
    Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you. For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.
    For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man per ish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.”
    Here, verses 15-17, Paul reveals that “all these things” are “working together” to strengthen the inner man.  In verse 18, he teaches us that the strengthening and uplifting does not come from the circumstances themselves (things which are seen), but rather, it comes from what the believer does through these periods of despair.   If he keeps his eyes on Jesus and his faith (things which are not seen—Heb.llzl) in God, then he truly is like a man who “built his house upon a rock” and remained safe through the storms of life.
    In Rom.8:26, Paul says that it is the Spirit who helps us in our weakened times and even makes intercession for us to God.  This is the
    \
    (8)
    secret of becoming an “overcomer”, namely, praying in the Spirit.  This is how we can be “led by the Spirit” (Rom.8:14).  Jude declares to us this same truth in verse 20.
    “But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost.”
    Even when we are not at liberty to pray, we can still retain our fortitude because we have purposed in our hearts to serve God.  This determination or “mind-set” becomes an impregnable wall against the enemy.  The Scriptures speak about this “mind-set”.
    “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.” (Rom.12:1-2)
    “Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee; because he trusteth in thee.” (Isa.26:3)
    Returning now to the second phrase in Rom.8:28, “the called according to his purpose (will)”, Paul forcefully and unambiguously revealed in the preceding chapters of this epistle that God’s elect was both Jew and Gentile.  It was in God’s plan and foreknowledge before the creation of the world that the “calling” was going to be to “whomsoever will” both Jew and Gentile.  God did not limit himself to be the God of the Jews exclusively.  This fact was revealed to the prophets in a mul titude of scriptures.
    The synopsis of Paul’s message thus far is found in Rom.8:29,30.
    “For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.
    Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justi fied, them he also- glorified.”
    In verse 29 and 30, Paul uses the word “predestinate” in a two fold way.  In an encompassing view, it refers to the recipients of God’s grace.  As is evident from Paul’s fore-going discussion, the idea of
    (9)
    predestination is used in the collective sense and not in the individual sense as many have presumed.  This is the very crux of Paul’s message and the very truth which he endeavored to proclaim—that both Jew and Gentile have been called (predestined) by God.  (Remember Peter’s vision in Acts 10 and Paul’s calling in Acts 9).
    Primarily, though, the word, as used in these two verses, entails purpose and provision.  The purpose was that the believers (both Jew and Gentile) would be “conformed to the image of his Son”.  As regards provision, Paul stated in Rom.7:18 that while under the law he did not have the ability nor power “to perform that which is good”.  However, in verse 25 of that chapter, he joyfully proclaims that the answer (provision) is found in Jesus Christ.
    In order to follow Paul ’s line of reasoning in Rom.8:29-30, we must of necessity start with verse 28.  In this verse, he states that God is using all things to bring about that good which he has ordained (Eph.2:10) for all believers to possess.  In actuality, Paul says the very same thing in verse 29, only in a different way.  The phrase “For whom he did foreknow” is the same as “to them who are the called” in verse 28.  He “predestinated” or willed (purpose—vs.28) that believers should be Christ-like.
    In verse 30, Paul sums it up this way:  God has predestined(foreordained) that all should be saved (2 Pet.3:9; Jn.3:15,16); in order for all to be saved, he calls them to repentance by the preaching of the Gospel (Rom.10:8-17); if they believe the Gospel message and accept Christ into their hearts, then God justifies them (Rom.5:1; 1 Cor.6:11); he then glorifies them by filling them with His Spirit (Rom.8:11; 2 Cor. 4:6,7).
    Before we consider the Ephesian passage where the word “predestinated” is used, we would like to cite just a few more passages in Romans.
    (10)
    We do this to emphasize to the reader the thought of Paul as regards the predestination or calling of the Gentiles to the Gospel as well as the Jew.
    “What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath (see 1 Thess.2:14-16) fitted to destruction: And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory. Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?”  (Rom.9:22-24)
    “I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
    God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
    Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their (Israel’s) fulness?
    For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.
    And so all Israel shall be saved; as it is written, There s-h-all come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:” (Rom.11:1,2,5,7,12,25,26)
    In Rom.9:22-24, Paul uses the phrases vessels of wrath and vessels of mercy to refer to the Jews and Gentiles, respectively.  Notice how he uses the pronoun us, thereby associating himself with the Gentiles. Again, we see the same thought how that God has predestined (afore pre pared) both Jew and Gentile to share in the glories of Christ.
    Romans 11 has proven to be a most controversial passage, especially verse 26.  The Dispensationalists have interpreted this chapter as proof of a national conversion of Israel.  However, this is not the teaching of Paul at all.  He states in verse 2 that God foreknew Israel after the flesh according to the covenant made to them (verse 27).  This cov enant was valid, however, only to those believing Jews (vss.5,7).  The believing remnant became the election.  Paul taught that the believing Jew and the believing Gentile (Rom.2:28,29) together composed the completed olive tree having both natural branches (Jews) and grafted bran-
    (11)
    ches (Gentiles). This is the context in which Paul uses the phrase all Israel in verse 26. The all was both the believing Jew and the believing Gentile.
    We will now turn our attention to the Ephesian letter, where Paul makes it even more clear to us how that God has predestined both Jew and Gentile to be partakers of the Gospel.  We see even better how Paul uses this word in a collective sense and not in an individual sense.
    “According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:
    Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will.
    To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.
    In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace; Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence; Having made known unto us the mystery of his will,’ according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself: That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him: In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purposeof him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:
    That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trust ed in Christ.” (Eph.1:4-12)
    If one were to read this passage without denominational prejudice or prior theological biasness, then the truth about predestination becomes self-evident.  Paul said that he became “all things to all men”. To the Jew, he became a Jew; to the Gentile, he became a Gentile.  Here, Paul, by using the pronouns “we” and “us”, demonstrates his oneness with the Gentile.  He does this same thing in other passages when addressing the Jewish converts.
    In this passage, Paul clearly shows that it was the Gentiles col lectivelythat were predestined by God to share in the Gospel message, so that, both Jew and Gentile would be gathered together “in one all
    (12)
    things in Christ”.  Notice Eph.2:ll-19.
    “Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh,who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands; That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world: But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.
    For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us; Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in him self of twain one new man, so making peace;
    And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:
    And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.
    For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.
    Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God.”
    To this truth the prophet Zechariah agreed.
    “Rejoice greatly, 0 daughter of Zion; shout, 0 daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.
    And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth.” (Zech.9:9,10)
    There is much similarity in the wording between the Roman epistle and the letter to Ephesus.  It is almost as if Paul used the same sermon notes when writing these two churches.  But really, if one were to carefully study the Pauline epistles, it would be discovered that this was a burning message inside the heart of Paul.  The fact that God had chosen both Jew and Gentile to become one in Christ was indelibly imprinted upon the conscience of Paul.  To preach this truth was the pas sionate desire of this great Apostle.
    As I have previously stated in this paper, the controversy over predestination would become greatly mitigated if Paul’s wording as found
    (13)
    in Romans 8:29,30 and Ephesians 1:5,11 would be read and interpreted
    in its greater context, and, in the context of the calling of the Apostle
    Paul.
    The predestination or calling of both the Jew and the Gentile was not a message which was unique to Paul, however, as is evident from Jesus’ own teaching in John 10:16.
    “And other sheep (Gentiles) I have, which are not of this fold (Jews): them also I must bring, and ‘they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.”
    In conclusion, I would like to make one final quote from Eph.3:l-12, so that, we may again emphasize that Paul speaks in the collectivesense when referring to the eternal purpose of God’s predestined plan for man, both Jew and Gentile.
    “For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,
    If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:
    How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,
    Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)
    Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;
    That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel: Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.
    Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the un searchable riches of Christ;
    And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:
    To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,
    According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:
    In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.”
    (14)
    Almost as a postscript, I must make one qualifying comment concerning the thesis of this paper.  When we state that predestination is used in the collective sense referring both to Jews and Gentiles, we do so in the context of how Paul used the word in the Roman and Ephesian passages. This is not to say that God is bound to operate only within these confines. God is sovereign and may choose to individually predestinate and ordain certain persons for specific ministries and callings.  Certainly the Apostle Paul would be a prime example of this prerogative.  But, again, we reiterate that the passages normally used to support predestination are not to be interpreted in the individual sense but in the collective sense.
    (15)
    WHY DOES SATAN HATE MANKIND?
    Because of the scarcity of information that the scriptures reveal concerning this topic, this paper can only be speculative and not dogmatic. Although speculative, this does not mean that the statements contained herein are without scriptural support.  It is only an admission that the Bible is not explicit in describing the events that predate man’s historical existence.  However, the Bible does provide us with enough evidence to implicitly make some very interesting conclusions. The following comments are submitted to the reader as a plausible answer to the question posed by the title of this paper.
    We have often heard it taught that it was Lucifer’s pride which prompted his rebellion against God. While pride is a definite character flaw of Lucifer, it was not this element in itself which caused him to rebel——- it was jealousy.  Pride was the “vehicle” which gave impetus to jealousy.  One can only have pride in that which he possesses, or at least, believes he possesses. Whereas, one becomes jealous over that which he does not pos sess.  Lust or jealousy will eventually cause one to resort to take that which he desires by force. We find this principle in James 4:1,2.
    “From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in vour members? Ye lust, and have not: (therefore) ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: (therefore) ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.”
    The inserted “therefore” gives justice to the Greek text which emphasizes the causative agent for the action verbs.
    This is exactly what Lucifer attempted. He was not content with the glory and beauty which was given him, instead he desired the glory which only God possessed.
    We find some very illuminating comments concerning Lucifer in Isaiah 14 and Ezekiel 28. Although these passages have a historical fulfillment in the kings of Babylon and Tyrus, the pride and glory of these kings/
    /”
    cities are reminiscent to that exhibited by Lucifer prior to his fall.
    “Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord God; Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.
    Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God...the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created.
    (1)
    Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee
    so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked
    up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.
    Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast
    created, till iniquity was found in thee.
    Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast
    corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness...” (Eze.28:12-15,17)
    From this passage, we find seven points worthy of consideration.
    (1) Thou sealest up the sum.  The act of sealing has reference to the signet ring. After a letter, document, or container had been closed, then some clay/wax was placed over the seal and then imprinted with the signet. This secured its privacy.  So, the “sealing up” was the last act done.  The “sum” has reference to the sum total of all the various strengths and beauties of the angelic host in totality.  Whereas some angels might have had few or maybe many strengths/glories, Lucifer possessed all the qualities which were given by God to this newly created host.
    (2) Full of wisdom.  Lucifer had full wisdom and knowledge of God’s total creation.  Everything that God created or would create in the future, Lucifer was given the knowledge of all the mysteries and magnificent wonders which were contained in all of God’s creation. Not only did he possess full wisdom and knowledge of God’s material and spiritual creative acts, he also, more than any other created being, was fully cognizant of the nature of God. Because of this knowledge, he was held accountable for his rebellious act and was not given a “second chance”.  “To whom much is given, much is required”.
    (3) Perfect in beauty.  It would be pure conjecture to begin to des cribe exactly in what ways angels are assigned variations in their beauty. It seems totally out of context for them to have some aberration such as a “spiritual wart”.  However, we do know that there are gradations in rank and power in the angelic realm.
    (4) The workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee.  Lucifer was created with the ability to produce music.  No doubt from his being came forth the most melodious sounds ever produced from God’s creation, and these were all sounds of praise to God.
    (5) Anointed cherub that covereth.  Here we see that Lucifer was ordained (anointed) for a specific purpose.  His position was that of authority over all the angels. The word for “covereth” denotes protect-tion and hence overseer or ruler of the angelic host.  Like the first phrase discussed, “thou sealest up the sum”, I believe this phrase also carries with it the connotation that Lucifer was the last angel created.
    (2)
    He, as it were, was the icing on the cake. God saved “the best for last” in regard to the magnificence of his creation. We see this same sequence in the earth’s creation, that is, man was created last.
    (6) Thou wast perfect.  Here again, the modifiers emphasize the ultimate of God’s creation.
    (7) Corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness.  Lucifer’s name means “light-bearing”.  I believe God gave Lucifer a glory, an aura of light, which was similar to God’s own radiance (1 John 1:5; 1 Tim.6:16; James 1:17) except on a much diminuated scale. No other angel received this glory, else Lucifer ’s name would have no unique significance.  One might object to this theory, however, in consideration of 2 Cor.11:14:
    “And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.”
    Although the indefinite article “an” is supplied in the translation, it is done so to enhance the fluidity of speech.  In the Greek, there are no indefinite articles as such. Generally, they are placed in translation in the absence of the definite article.  Oftentimes in prepositional phrases the definite article is not used although it is supplied in the translation.  The context is what actually determines whether the definite or indefinite article is used.  Here, in the text before us, it is assumed that all angels are angels of light, consequently, we find the indefinite article.
    Michael the archangel acknowledged this manifested glory of Lucifer even after Lucifer’s fall. We find in Jude 9 that Michael “dared not bring against him (Lucifer) a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee”. Michael remembered and respected the position that Lucifer once held.  As a result of his pride and fascination of his own glory and brightness, he began to lose sight of his creative purpose, that is, to lead the angels in worship and praise to God.  Because of this ego-centric adoration, it caused him to minimize the omnipotence of God, thus, his wisdom (knowledge of the holiness and righteousness of God) was corrupted (obscured) “by reason of his brightness”.
    We shall now examine the passage found in Isaiah 14.  As we have previously stated, the Isaiah passage describes the fall of the king of Babylon. However, it is believed by many expositors that the language used depicts more than just the fall of an earthly king, but is reminiscent of the fall of Lucifer himself.
    (3)
    ”How art thou fallen from heaven, 0 Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!
    For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God.  I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north; I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.” (Isa.14:12-14)
    In verse 12, we find that Satan’s name before his fall was Lucifer. Of course, as already noted, Lucifer means “lightbearer” or “brightness”. In that same verse, he is referred to as “son of the morning” or “day star”. We will comment on this appellation given to Lucifer in a later discussion.
    Beginning with verse 13, we find the five infamous “I wills” of Lucifer. Again, we reiterate that pride in itself does not incite rebellion since it is a passive quality.  Lucifer had pride in what he possessed;but it was his jealousy which prompted him to try to obtain that which he did not possess.
    We will now examine Lucifer’s five “I wills”.
    (1) I will ascend into heaven.  This first “I will” is in actuality the same as the last “I will”.  It merely reveals his ultimate goal. The other 3 “I wills” are secondary objectives which must be accomplished before his ultimate goal can be realized.  The reference to heaven refers to the habitation of God himself.  It is that sphere of space which truly makes heaven—heaven.  His yearning and desire is not to just be in the periphery of God’s dwelling and habitation, but to be in the very center itself.  In other words, he desired to occupy the position and place which God alone occupies.
    (2) I will exalt my throne above the stars of God.  Lucifer was not content to rule amongst the angelic host, but wanted to elevate his rule and dominion to a position far above them.  He was not satisfied to be the leader of his peers, but rather, to be the tyrannical ruler of the other angels placing them in a position far inferior to that of his own.
    (3) I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north.  At first glance, this appears to be a much obscured and poetic expression.  But after closer examination, one finds a very noteworthy gem which has often been casually overlooked. We must first do a word study of the key words in this phrase to regain the full import and meaning which might have been lost in translation.  The word sit may more appropriately be rendered dwell or inhabit. Mountnot only means mountain
    (4)
    or hill, but may be used figuratively in Scripture to mean promotion or an elevated place of honor.  Of the three Hebrew words translated congregation, one is used 140 times out of 356 with the phrase, “tabernacle of the congregation” or “tent of the congregation”.  It is by no coincidence that this particular Hebrew word (Strong’s â»4150) is only used in conjunction with God’s earthly dwelling place—the tabernacle. Thus used, it refers to the “appointed place of meeting”instead of just an “assembly”.  The word sides means border, coast, or parameter.  The word north has a special significance. We observe in Numbers 2:25 that the tribe of Dan was to be positioned on the north side of the tabernacle when the children of Israel encamped.  In Gen. 49:16, it states that “Dan shall judge his people”. God ordained that the place of judgment would be symbolically positioned to the north.  The Psalmist David was more than just a king; he was also a prophet.  In Psalms 75:2-7, we find some interesting parallels.
    “When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly. The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it.  Selah.
    I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn;
    Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck. For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south. But God is the judge; he putteth down one, and setteth up another.”
    Here, we see the Spirit of prophecy speaking in the first person. Notice such key words as:  congregation (Strong’s â»4150), judge, and promotion. Notice also that by its absence, north is the place of promotion or judgment. The mention of “horn” in verses 4&5 has reference to the oriental accoutrement worn by the married women.  It was a pointed object made of tin/silver which was used to attach the veil.  The married women which had children wore their “horns” higher on the head than those married women which were childless. (See 1 Sam.2:1-10).  Thus, the horn symbolized a place/position of honor.
    So God, speaking through David, states that he alone dwells in the place of judgment and honor. It is this very place of honor/judgment which Lucifer coveted to inhabit.
    It should be further noted that the Father has given to the Son this authority to judge and rule. (See Isa.2:4; 11:4; 2 Tim.4:1,8; Col.1:13-19; 1 Cor.15:24-28; Rev.19:11).  So, we see that Lucifer had become brazen and bold enough to contemplate usurping that position of honor and glory belong ing to the Son of God and taking it for himself.
    (5)
    We can find this Divine decree of God manifested in his physical creation, also.  Man’s orientation, that is, judgment of bearing, is based upon the earth’s magnetic north.  Also, night navigators use the North Star as a reference point or guide.  It is the only heavenly body whose position remains constant throughout all the seasons.  Truly, it is the north that we must use as the rule or standard in order to judge our bearing.
    (4) I will ascend above the heights of the clouds.  This phraseology conjures up to the Jewish mind a lofty image.  In many of the Rabbinic writings, the Christ or Messiah was referred to as bar nivli —“Son of the clouds”.  He was also known as “the Cloudy One”.  The Old Testament is replete with passages which allude to God in relation to clouds.  Job 22:14, Psa.l8:12, and Dan.7:13 are just a few of such references.  The New Testament, also, has many allusions of Christ and the clouds:  Matt.24:30; Matt. 26:64; Acts 1:9-11; 1 Thess.4:17; and Rev.1:7.  I believe that clouds are representative of the shekinah glory—the physical manifestation of the magnificence of Deity.
    Here, again, we see the intentions of Lucifer to usurp the position and prominence of Christ.  There is a definite sequence of gradation in the “I wills”.  First, he wanted to raise his rule above the other angels. Next, he wanted to place himself in the seat of judgment which belonged to Christ.  Now, he wants to elevate his authority and position above that of Christ.
    At this time, we will consider the phrase found in verse 12——“son of the morning” or otherwise translated “day star”.  I do not believe that this was a name given to Lucifer by God, but rather, it was a name which he stole from Christ.  He tried to sway the other angels in believing that he was the real “day star” because of his luminescent beauty and glory. But the Scriptures plainly reveal the identity of the “Son of the morning” or “Day Star”.
    “We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts.” (2 Pet.1:19)
    “I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches.  I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.” (Rev.22:16)
    “Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us.” (Luke 1:78)
    (6)
    (5) I will be like the Most High.  Lucifer, here, reaches the zenith of his arrogance.  He wanted to be placed on the same plane and echelon as the Father himself.  Truly, the Bible is true when it states that, “Pride goeth before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall”.
    Having laid our foundation, we will now propose to the reader not only a possible but we believe a very plausible answer to the question posed by the title of this paper.
    In actuality, the answer is two-fold. The first part of the answer will now be discussed.
    When God began to create the celestial heavens and the earth, there was much excitement in heaven concerning God’s newest creation—man.  It was rumored that God was going to make man in God’s own image. News of this soon reached the ears of Lucifer.  He was infuriated.  Who else deserved to share in God’s glory but the “lightbearer” himself.  He began at once to plan his strategy.
    Let’s leave Lucifer to his diabolical plans, momentarily, and turn to the Bible to determine exactly what all the excitement was about.  Because of the abundance of scriptures which reveal the truth of which we are about to explore, we must limit our study to only a representative sample. We shall begin with John 14:16-18.
    “And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;
    Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him; but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless; I will come to you.”
    The time of this discourse was sometime during the Passion week, the last week of Jesus’ earthly ministry before his crucifixion. He promises to his beloved disciples that he would send them another Comforter whom he calls the “Spirit of truth”. Jesus once said that he was, “...the Way, the Truth, and the Life”. Notice, too, that he says that this “Spirit of truth” presently dwells with them and shall soon dwell in them.  In verse 18, he removes the doubt in their minds as to who this “Spirit of truth” really was by plainly stating that it was he (Christ) who would not leave them comfortless, but would indeed come back to them.  In verse 23 of that same chapter, Jesus said that both he and the Fatherwould come and make their abode in the Believer’s heart.
    Paul in Romans 8:9,10 spoke of this same truth.
    (7)
    ”But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.  Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
    And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.”
    The picture becomes more clear when we read Romans 8:18.
    “For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.”
    The word translated “revealed” is the Greek word apokalupto (Strong’s â»601) which literally means to “take off the cover” or “unveil”.  So, Paul says that there is a certain “glory” which dwells in us that shall one day be “unveiled”.  In 2 Cor.4:7, Paul refers to this glory as “treasure in earthen vessels”.
    Peter says that the Believers are “partakers of the Divine nature” (1 Pet.1:4).  He also tells of the unveiling of this Divine glory in 1 Pet. 4:13 and 1 Pet.5:1.  It is that same glory that Peter beheld on the Mount of Transfiguration that shall one day be unveiled within every Believer.
    John, in his first epistle, tells of this same truth.
    “Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.” (1 John 3:2)
    There is one more passage of Scripture which becomes very illuminating as we begin to piece together this intriguing puzzle.
    “Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow. Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.” (1 Pet.1:11,12)
    Peter says that the angels desired to look into this heavenly gift called the Holy Ghost which God gave to Man.  The Greek word for “look” means to “lean over”.  It is a vivid picture of the angelic host leaning over heaven’s balcony in order to get a better view of this unspeakable gift to man.  Lucifer’s rebellion was still fresh on their minds, and they knew that it was this very glory that Lucifer coveted.  That historical rebellion left an indelible impact upon heaven’s angels.  They witnessed the awesome power and judgment of the Omnipotent, Omniscient, and Omnipresent God.  Although they were innocent and non-participants of the rebellion, they became very cognizant and defensive of any thought or act that might challenge the authority of their Almighty Creator.
    (8)
    That is why Paul warned the Corinthian women in 1 Cor.11:10 to always wear their veil.  The veil was the symbol of the authority of the husband over the wife.  Paul told them to wear it “because of the angels”. The angels became offended by any act of misconduct and irreverence.
    So, we see that one of the reasons why Satan hates mankind is because of his jealousy. While this may be true, it still does not satisfy the zealand the degree in which Satan (Gr. diabolos: adversary) attacks mankind.  This brings us to the second, and the more sinister, reason for this Satanic attack.
    Upon hearing the news concerning the glory that was going to be bestowed upon man, Lucifer lost control of his thoughts because of his anger.  However, he quickly regained his composure in order to devise his master plan.  He gathered all the information he could about this new creation of God.  He learned (by very reliable sources) that man was going to be the last of God’s creation.  Lucifer knew all too well that the “best was saved for last”.  It was rumored throughout the courts of heaven that God had a very special love for mankind and that he would do practically anything to save man from the anguish which the fallen angels were destined to receive.
    Lucifer reasoned that if he could somehow get man to rebel (sin) against God, then God would undoubtedly intervene to help man because of his great love for him.  If God did this, Lucifer believed that this would be evidence that a travesty of justice had occurred and, consequent ly, would try to get his sentence suspended.
    We know from the Genesis account, that Lucifer succeeeded in getting man to sin against God.  He did not get to revel long in his triumph, though.  God told him that man was naive and innocent in his beginning and did not have the knowledge about God’s holiness and righteousness as he had.  Therefore, God provided man with a “second chance” as is recorded in Genesis 3:15.
    We would like to digress for a moment and consider the words which Satan spoke to Eve in Genesis 3:1-5.
    “Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made.  And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:”
    (9)
    ”But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
    And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.”
    Adam Clarke in his commentary gives substantial proof that the phrase “as gods” should rather be translated “like God”.  Here, Satan promises to Eve that the possessor of knowledge would become like God himself. Remember, this is what Lucifer thought prior to his fall. Because of his immense knowledge, he reasoned that he should receive worship just as did Jehovah God.  This false teaching was instituted and promulgated by the “Father of lies” and has found its way into a multitude of philosophies and religions in nearly every generation since its inception in the Garden of Eden. We are not surprised to find his lie taught in many of the Eastern Religions, among cults such as Mormonism, and in such philosophies as humanism.  But we do become disturbed when we see this same lie taught in many conservative, evangelical movements in the Christian faith today.  We will give a few quotes from some very popular Bible teachers who believe in this ancient heresy.  It is not our purpose to negate the worth nor sincerity of any of these ministries, but rather, to expose only that portion of their ministry which is un-scriptural and detrimental to the Body of Christ.  For a more comprehen sive expose’ of this fallacious doctrine, we suggest the book written by Dave Hunt and T. A. McMahon, The Seduction of Christianity.  The following quotes, in fact, are taken directly from their book.
    “Robert Tilton is emerging as one of America’s most influential pastors.  About 1400 other churches across the country (that number also is growing) are connected by satellite to his church in Dallas, from which they may pick up live special events, speakers, conferences, and teaching seminars.  In keeping with the basic theology underlying the Positive Confession movement, as we have already seen, Tilton believes that man was created to be the god of this earth, that he lost this dominion to Satan, who became the god of this world, and that it is up to us to take that dominion back from Satan and begin functioning as the gods of this world once again. In order for this to happen, we Christians, must begin, as E.W. Kenyon taught, to ‘walk as Jesus walked, without any consciousness of inferiority to God..,have[ing] faith that will stagger the world...’  Echoing this teaching, Kenneth Copeland declares: And you impart humanity into a child that’s born of you ....Because you are a human, you have imparted the nature
    (10)
    nature of humanity into that born child.
    God is God. He is a Spirit... And He imparted in you when you were born again—Peter said it just as plain, he said, ‘We are partakers of the Divine Nature.’ That Nature is ative eternal in absolute perfection, and that was imparted, injected into your spirit man, and you have that imparted into you by God just the same as you imparted into your child the nature of humanity.
    That child wasn’t born a whale.  It was born a human... Well, now, you don’t have a human, do you? No, you are one. You don ’t have a God in you.  You are one. As we have already documented, this is not a slip of the tongue or some new doctrine.  This is at the heart of the Positive Confession movement today, and can be traced back to numerous groups of earlier eras, such as the Manifested Sons of God and Latter Rain movements.  It is in the writings of leaders in these earlier movements, such as Kenyon, Branham, and John G. Lake that we first find the major teachings of Hagin, Cope-land, Capps, etc.  Lake wrote:  ‘Man is not a separate creation detached from God, he is part of God Himself...God intends us to be gods...He is calling forth a soul-awakening to the real ization that the man within is the real man.  The inner man is the real governor, the true man that Jesus said was a god. ’ Lake’s sermons (The God-Men, etc.) are still being published today by Christ for the Nations.  Pastor/author Earl Paulk is one of today’s leaders in this growing movement.  Says Paulk:
    Just as dogs have puppies and cats have kittens, so God has little gods....
    Until we comprehend that we are little gods and we begin to act like little gods, we cannot manifest the Kingdom of God.”
    We will not attempt to make an extensive refutation of the arguments they use to document their teaching, but we will consider one passage of scripture which is frequently quoted in support of their view.
    “Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?” (John 10:34)
    In order to better understand the meaning and intent of this start ling declaration made by Jesus, we will quote a few prominent Bible scholars,
    “It is of course, to civil governors, especially those entrusted with the administration of justice, that the prophet addresses this stern admonition.  He calls them “the gods”, and “the sons of the Most High”. To the people of Israel this kind of appellation would not seem over bold: for it was applied to judges in well-known texts of the Law of Moses. Thus, in the code of civil statutes delivered at Sinai, it is said, ‘Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people’.  Exod.22:28. Nor is that the only instance of the kind.  In two other passages of the same code (Exod.21:6, and 22:8,9), the word which our translators have rendered “the judges”, is in the Hebrew, “the gods”, or “God”.  Since the ordinary Hebrew word for God (Elohim) is almost always used in the plural form, it is hard to say whether the law in Exodus 21:6, be rendered thus, ‘his (the bondman’s) master shall bring him to the gods’; or, with the Septuagint, ‘his master shall bring him to the judgment-seat of God’.  In
    (11)
    either case the terms are plainly meant to imply that the Majesty of God is present in the place of judgment.  As it is said of Solomon that ‘he sat on the throne of the LORD as King, 1 1 Chron.29:23, so it may be said of every magistrate that he sits in God’s seat.” William Binnie.   The Treasury of David —C.H.Spurgeon.—
    “The judges of Israel abused their office and God is represented in Psa.82:6 as calling them ‘gods’ (theoi, elohim) because they were God’s representatives.  See the same use of elohim in Exod.21:6; 22:9,28.  Jesus meets the rabbis on their own ground in a thoroughly Jewish way.  As Jews (and rabbis) they are shut out from charging Jesus with blasphemy because of this usage in the O.T.  It is a complete ad hominem argument...These judges had no other claim to the term theoi (elohim).” Word Pictures in the New Testament —A.T.Robertson.
    “On this occasion He merely shows that even a man could without blasphemy call himself ‘Son of God’; because their own judges had been called ‘gods’...In Psa.82, the judges of Israel are rebuked for abusing their office...The judges were made ‘gods’ by the coming to them of God’s commission, which found them engaged otherwise and itself raised them to their new rank...If the former might be legitimately called ‘gods’, the latter may well claim to be God’s Son.” The Expositor’s Greek Testament — W.Robertson Nicoll.
    The fundamental premise and, consequently, erroneous assumption made by the “God-men” adherents is that they believe that man’s nature is transformed into God’s nature and essence beginning at the New Birth and culminating at Christ’s Second Coming.  It is true that Christians are “sons of God”, but they are “sons” by adoption. Whereas, Jesus is “the Son of God” by procreation (John 8:42).  The Father and the Son share the same essence (John 10:30).  This essence dwells within the heart of every Believ er (John 14:23). The Christian’s spirit (the human spirit) remains just that—a human spirit.  Its essence remains just as God created it—it does not transform itself into Divinity.  The “glory” that will one day be revealed/unveiled within the Believer is the “indwelling Spirit”.  At the Second Advent, all the Redeemed will revert back to their original, innocent position they had before the Fall with two additional changes: (1) their mortal bodies will be changed to a glorified body like Jesus’ own glorified one, and (2) the essence of Deity will eternally indwell them.
    Some may argue that there is no real menace and inherent harm in the “God-men” doctrine and we are making a “mountain out of a mole-hill”. But we must always be cognizant of Satan’s tactics.  He seldom brings to us a total untruth, but oftentimes disguises it with partialtruth.  So it is with this false teaching.  He wants man to be guilty of the very thing that he was found guilty of, that is, taking from God that which can only be God’s.  The essence of Deity can never be claimed by man as be-
    (12)
    longing to man.  Our only right and honor is to be chosen to be vessels in which Deity may dwell.
    Returning now to the drama of the ageless antipathy between Satan and man, we find Satan plotting still~another devious scheme.  He still believed that his basic plan would work.  From the prophecy given in Gen.3:15, Satan knew that man’s “Deliverer” would come from the “seed of woman” or mankind itself.  Satan, thereupon, postulated that if he could gain absolute control of mankind, then he would be in position to manipulate and control the “seed of woman” to his own advantage thereby thwarting God’s plan. We find Satan’s scheme put in’ action in Gen.6:1-5.
    “And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
    There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
    And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.”
    The identity of the “sons of God” has proven to be a most volatile issue in theological circles.  There are two popular views which attempt to explain this controversial passage.
    Many interpret the “sons of God” to be the righteous lineage of Seth. However, this does not answer how the union of the “sons of God” with the “daughters of men” produced the giants which, in the context, were a def inite consequence of such a union.
    The other view defended by many Bible students is that the “sons of God” were angels who left their heavenly habitation and actually had sexual intercourse with the “daughters of men”.  This theory, too, has many difficulties and inextricable ramifications. The following are just a few arguments against such an inexplicable proposition:
    (1) Matt.22:30 gives us some idea as to the nature of the saints in heaven and also of the nature of the angels themselves.
    “For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.”
    Also, in Hebrews 1:7 the Bible tells us unequivocally that angels are spirit beings.  That is why they desire to inhabit fleshly tabernacles.
    (13)
    (2) Nowhere in Scripture do we find any allusion that angels have the power or ability to procreate. On the other hand, the converse is affirmed.
    (3) Furthermore, it would be contradictory to God’s established law that “...the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind...” (Gen.1:24).
    There is another view which, although not as well known as those previously cited, we believe to be more aligned with scriptural teachings concerning God, man, and Satan.  Henry M. Morris in his book, The Genesis Record, gives a detailed explanation of this particular view. We will now provide excerpts from his commentary so that the reader would become better acquainted with, we believe, the more sound exegetical answer to this perplexing passage.
    “The identity of the ‘giants’ is discussed further below, but the seriousness of this problem does have a bearing on how we should interpret these unions.  Fallen angels have no possibility of salvation, but fallen men and women do have at least this possibility. What, then, would be the case with ‘people 1 who were half-angel, half-men?
    This seems to be such a grotesque situation that it does appear extremely doubtful that God would have allowed it at all, even if it really were physiologically a realistic possibility.  And yet, as already, indicated, it does violence to the actual text of the passage if we make it mean merely that the sons of Seth began to marry the daughters of Cain.
    ...On the other hand, is it not possible that the Bible has the true record and these various legends of giants and demigods represent the distortions that had accrued through long centuries of verbal transmission of the tales in cultures removed from the true patriarchal transmission line?
    It is significant that the Septuagint renders the phrase ‘sons of God’ as ‘angels of God’.  This was the Old Testament version in dominant use in the Apostolic period, and thus this would be the way the phrase would have been read by Christ and His apostles.
    ...A solution seems to consist in recognizing that the children were true human children of truly human fathers and mothers, but that all were possessed and controlled by evil spirits.  That is, these fallen angelic ‘sons of God’ accomplished their purposes by something equivalent to demon possession, indwelling the bodies of human men, and then also taking (or ‘possessing’) the bodies of the women as well...Thus, the ‘sons of God 1 controlled not only the men whose bodies they had acquired for their own exploitation, but also the women they took to themselves in this way, and then all the children they bore.
    ...This fearful phenomenon of demonic ‘taking’ and ‘habitation’ of human bodies has often been repeated since, though apparently never yet on the global scale which Satan attempted in the days of Noah.
    ...The chilren of the unions of the demonically controlled men and women of this period are the ones said to have become the ‘giants’, the mighty men of old. The word in the Hebrew is nephilim and comes from the
    (14)
    verb naphal (‘fall’). Though some commentators suggest that the word means ‘those who fall upon’, that is, attackers...The name came also to mean ‘giants’ and was applied later to the giants seen in Canaan by the Israelite spies (Numbers 13:33).
    ...Factors for large physical stature apparently have resided from the beginning in the created gene pool of the human population.  Their emergence as frequent or dominant characteristics in a specific population might result by chance in a small inbreeding population or else might result by design in the case of controlled manipulation of the genes by breeders understanding enough about the genetic process to do this.  Geneticists today appear on the verge of breakthroughs which would permit exactly such ‘genetic engineering’ as this sort of thing to be accomplished on a practical basis.
    ...The point is that, if modern geneticists can discuss with all seriousness the imminent possibility of accomplishing such things, then it is not unlikely that knowledge of these secrets could have been available to the angelic (and demonic) hosts.  Having gained essentially complete control over both minds and bodies of these antediluvian parents, these fallen ‘sons of God* could then, by some such genetic manipulation, cause their progeny to become a race of monsters.  The latter also then would be under their control and possession as well.”
    With this position in mind, one can readily see how Satan was working behind the scenes to further his goals.  Of course, we know the “rest of the story”, as Paul Harvey characteristically phrases it.  God judged this wicked antediluvian world by destroying it with a global flood.
    This did not dampen Satan’s attempt at world domination, however. In Genesis 10 & 11, we find Satan making still another attempt at controlling the destiny of man.
    “And Cush begat Nimrod; he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
    He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.” (Gen.10:8-10).
    From these few obscure verses, Rev. Alexander Hislop in his book, The Two Babylons, traces the ancient Babylonian, Roman, and Grecian pantheons as originating from the worship of Nimrod.  His work is a comprehensive study of pagan religions from an etymological, historical, and cultural perspective.  It is a monumental work which is fully documented.
    Adam Clarke gives some very enlightening comments concerning Nimrod.
    “His name Nimrod comes from marad, he rebelled; and the Targum, on 1 Chron.l:10, says: ‘Nimrod began to be a mighty man in sin, a murderer of innocent men, and a rebel before the Lord’.  The Jerusalem Targum says:  ‘He was mighty in hunting (or in prey) and in sin before God, for he was a hunter of the children of men in their languages; and he said unto them, Depart from the religion of Shem, and cleave to the institutes

    of Nimrod’.  The Syriac calls him a warlike giant.  The word tsayid, which we render hunter, signifies prey; and is applied in the Scriptures to the hunting of men by persecution, oppression, and tyranny.  Hence it is likely that Nimrod, having acquired power, used it in tyranny and oppression; and by rapine and violence founded that domination which was the first distinguished by the name of a kingdom on the face of the earth.”
    So, from these accounts, we can see how Satan manipulated man in a great apostasy against God. Again, God supernaturally intervenes with the confusion of languages.  The brevity of this paper will not permit us to delineate every circumstance in which Satan manuevered behind the scenes to destroy the chosen race which would one day bring forth the “Deliverer”.
    The next segment of this unfolding drama brings us to the birth of Christ.  Satan’s role in this scene is illustrated in the twelfth chapter of Revelation.
    “And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:
    And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.
    And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.
    And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.
    And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.” (Rev.12:1-5).
    Satan knew that this was his “last chance”.  He knew that if Jesus succeeded in his mission to earth, then all hope for him (Satan) to have his sentence and judgment reprieved would be hopelessly lost.  Failing in his efforts to destroy Christ in his infanthood, he later tries to persuade Jesus in the “desert temptation” to worship him, again without any success. Satan was utterly and ultimately defeated at the death of Christ and his resultant resurrection.
    In this paper, we have presented the thesis that Satan’s attacks on man are based on an ulterior motive that if mankind would totally aposta-size against God, then God would (because of his great love for man—Jn.3:lo) somehow absolve man of his sin.  Satan thus reasoned that this would be evidence of an inequity in the justice of God and that God would be obligated to absolve him also of his infamous sin of rebellion.  With this in
    (16)
    mind, one may wonder what continues to motivate Satan in his assaults against man.  The only logical answer accounting for his relentless fury aimed at mankind must be attributed to his unadulterated hatred against this most treasured of God’s creation. This hatred is most probably due to his jealousy of man’s potentially exalted position which he himself lusted after eons before.  The very glory that he desired to share with God will one day be shared with this newest creation of God.  Cognizant of his own doomed destiny, he now tirelessly tries to infect man with that rebellious spirit which resulted in his own downfall.
    At this point, the reader probably thinks’ that this must be the end of this ignoble saga between Satan and man.  It would be except for one other scenario that is worthy of consideration.
    We have previously made the presumption that Satan’s master plan against man was entirely his own fabrication.  But the Bible allows for another possible proposition.  The first hint we find in the Bible concerning this inconceivable supposition is found in Job 1:8.
    “And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?”
    Here, we notice that God actually challenges Satan to try and dissuade Job from serving God.  Could it be possible that it was God who initiated this bold proposal to Satan that “if man utterly failed in serving God then indeed Satan would be given a reprieve?” Since this may be a revolutionary new concept, your first reply might well be—Preposterous! But before you completely dismiss the idea, consider for a moment the basis for such an argument.
    Let ’s look again at the text in Job.
    “Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them. And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
    And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?
    Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.”
    (17)
    ”And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand.  So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.” (Job 1:6-12).
    “Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.” (Job 2:1).
    There are two significant points, gleaned from the text, which we wish to emphasize.  First of all, doesn’t it seem strange that Satan should even be allowed in heaven before the very presence of God? Remember, this is the very personage that led in the rebellion against the authority of the very God who created him.  It staggers the ‘mind that God would permit such an irreverence.  The only possible explanation for such an appearance before the majesty of God is that Satan had a right and authority to frequent heaven’s court’s at will.  Of course, God is omnipotent and only he could have granted such a privilege.  It is almost as if Satan had his foot in heaven’s door. Undoubtedly, when he did enter heaven’s glorious estate, the thought and hope of one day being restored to his former position overwhelmed him.
    The second point we will consider reinforces the first.  According to Strong’s Exhaustive Concordance, the word “present” (â»3320) means “to place [anything so as to stay]”.  This denotes permanency.  The word was first used with the “sons of God” in Job 1:6, but with boththe “sons of God” and Satan in Job 2:1.
    The question may now arise whether or not Satan still has this privilege granted to him.  The answer is an emphatic No!  When then was this right revoked? Satan lost all hopes of ever regaining his lofty position at Jesus’ first advent. Not only was Jesus the victor in his desert tempta tion and at his resurrection, but the victors crown was even passed on to his disciples.
    “And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name. And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.
    Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.
    Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are writ ten in heaven.” (Luke 10:17-20).
    One final passage will be quoted to offer as evidence that Satan “had, but lost” all right of claim of ever regaining his heavenly residence.
    (18)
    Notice that this eviction happened at Jesus’ first advent,  
    Truly, This was the real “Paradise Lost”
    “And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought a- gainst the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.
    And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” (Rev.12:7-9,17).
    This paper has proposed to the reader two basic reasons for the ageless antipathy between Man and Satan:  (1) Initially, Satan’s motivation was due to a self-serving goal in which his ultimate destiny hinged upon the faithfulness or unfaithfulness of man to God and, (2) Since his plan was aborted by Jesus’ redemptive sacrifice and resurrection, Satan’s resultant motivation was attributed to his jealousy of Man’s future elevated place of glory.
    In conclusion, because of many controversial statements presented in this paper, the writer wishes to quote a famous Bible scholar who made this apropos comment:
    “If, however, any person should choose to differ from the opinion stated above, he is at perfect liberty so to do; I make it no article of faith, nor of Christian communion; I crave the same liberty to judge for myself that I give to others, to which every man has an indisputable right; and I hope no man will call me a heretic for departing in this respect from the common opinion.”
